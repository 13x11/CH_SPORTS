01:06.083 --> 01:07.583
<i>- Moko.
- Yes?</i>

01:08.875 --> 01:11.583
- Are you almost done?
- Almost. I just washed my hair.

01:11.666 --> 01:13.208
I mean, I'm about to.

01:13.333 --> 01:15.166
You can't even remember?

01:15.750 --> 01:17.708
- Now what?
- I'm washing my hair.

01:18.833 --> 01:19.791
Please hurry.

01:22.500 --> 01:25.458
- All right, just a second.
- Moko, please hurry.

01:25.541 --> 01:28.000
- Get in line.
- The line starts here.

01:28.083 --> 01:31.375
- Yes, after Woko.
- I really need to poop. Woko!

01:31.458 --> 01:33.666
Get in line!

01:33.750 --> 01:35.666
Okay. One second. Almost done.

01:38.291 --> 01:41.333
See, I'm out.

01:41.416 --> 01:42.458
I was first.

01:42.541 --> 01:44.458
I intended to knock before you.

01:44.541 --> 01:46.833
"Intended"? Ask the door who was first.

01:46.916 --> 01:48.958
I intended it first, God knows!

01:49.041 --> 01:52.333
- Ano!
- I really had to go.

01:54.250 --> 01:55.708
- What?
- Rude!

01:55.791 --> 01:58.500
But it's worse to poop in my pants.

01:59.125 --> 02:00.333
Oh, gosh.

02:01.583 --> 02:04.125
And I have an exam today.

02:04.208 --> 02:07.458
If you let me shower first,
I'll finish faster.

02:08.041 --> 02:11.041
Faster? You usually take
two hours to shower.

02:11.125 --> 02:12.291
Two hours?

02:12.375 --> 02:16.916
I'm serious. I've repainted this wall
while waiting for you.

02:18.416 --> 02:20.000
You didn't even do it right.

02:20.083 --> 02:21.583
- Stop.
- I was joking.

02:21.666 --> 02:23.791
It's just that you take forever to shower.

02:23.875 --> 02:25.208
Not two hours, though.

02:25.291 --> 02:28.666
I've always given in.
I always let you go first.

02:28.750 --> 02:30.583
But today, I have an exam, Moko.

02:30.666 --> 02:33.500
- I haven't studied yet.
- Who told you not to study?

02:34.291 --> 02:36.208
No one. I just haven't.

02:36.291 --> 02:38.875
All right. Do your shower
in stages then. Come on.

02:38.958 --> 02:41.125
That's better than being late. Come on.

02:41.208 --> 02:43.250
- You've got soap all over.
- Where?

02:43.375 --> 02:45.750
You want to be quick, right? Do it here.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.041
No. I'll do it inside.

02:47.125 --> 02:48.541
- In stages.
- Not good enough.

02:51.583 --> 02:53.416
What are you up to?

02:54.458 --> 02:56.083
Where's my watch?

02:58.625 --> 03:01.208
Here, Atmo. Take your medicine.

03:03.541 --> 03:05.666
Agnes, help me with the tie.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.166
Someone is about to graduate from college.

03:10.750 --> 03:14.500
Stay calm, okay? Focus.

03:14.583 --> 03:18.291
You can do it. I'm proud of you, Moko.

03:19.666 --> 03:23.000
- What are you trying to do?
- What? This isn't done yet.

03:23.083 --> 03:26.208
The knot you made is too thick.

03:26.291 --> 03:29.333
- Twice. Left and right.
- No. Look.

03:29.416 --> 03:32.041
Twice left and right knots
are for old men.

03:32.125 --> 03:35.666
He's a college student.
People might mistake him for a professor.

03:35.750 --> 03:38.583
Moko may look young,
but inside, he's like a professor.

03:38.666 --> 03:40.500
No, not like a professor.

03:40.583 --> 03:42.083
- What?
- He's just old.

03:43.125 --> 03:44.875
- Here it is. Look.
- No way.

03:44.958 --> 03:48.708
My tie looks better
because it's neat and more formal.

03:48.791 --> 03:51.250
That's how I tie yours too.

03:51.333 --> 03:54.375
That's because I'm an old man.
Now just tuck it in.

03:54.458 --> 03:56.708
- Moko!
- Yes!

03:56.791 --> 03:58.083
He's coming.

03:59.291 --> 04:02.208
Slow down. Don't run.

04:04.625 --> 04:05.666
I'm going, Agnes.

04:07.166 --> 04:08.125
Bye, Ima.

04:08.208 --> 04:10.375
- You can do it, Uncle Moko.
- "Big brother."

04:10.458 --> 04:12.625
Fine. Big brother. He prefers that.

04:12.708 --> 04:13.875
Atmo.

04:14.416 --> 04:15.916
- Mom, Dad. We're going.
- Stay focused.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.750
- Take care, Woko. Ano.
- Wish me luck, okay?

04:17.833 --> 04:20.000
- Bye.
- Uncle, Aunty. We're going.

04:23.500 --> 04:24.583
Bye!

04:24.666 --> 04:26.083
- Bye!
- Bye!

04:28.458 --> 04:30.083
Bye!

04:30.166 --> 04:31.375
Say bye to the baby.

04:34.291 --> 04:37.625
- Look how big he is.
- Yeah. Look at him.

04:39.875 --> 04:41.333
Bye!

04:52.250 --> 04:55.000
Where is Ima? Oh, wow!

05:13.791 --> 05:14.875
Moko.

05:16.083 --> 05:17.500
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:18.041 --> 05:20.208
- Are you ready?
- Yes. You?

05:22.458 --> 05:24.250
Try them on.

05:24.875 --> 05:27.125
- Try what?
- Just try them on.

05:27.875 --> 05:29.375
Is it the right size?

05:30.166 --> 05:31.041
Maurin?

05:31.583 --> 05:35.791
It's okay. Just once in a while, Moko.
Here, try these.

05:37.208 --> 05:38.250
Come on. Put them on.

05:38.833 --> 05:41.250
- I'm being an inconvenience.
- No, it's fine.

05:41.333 --> 05:43.416
- Rin.
- Come on, put them on.

06:04.083 --> 06:05.541
- Do they fit?
- Yes.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.416
Thanks.

06:25.541 --> 06:28.333
You shouldn't be worried
about the thesis defense.

06:28.416 --> 06:33.416
You're the top student in our class.
Got a scholarship for grad school.

06:34.500 --> 06:38.625
- But when it comes to scholarships--
- You have no reason to be nervous.

06:38.708 --> 06:39.958
If the examiners ask--

06:40.041 --> 06:43.166
Moko, if you're nervous,
what about the others?

06:45.041 --> 06:46.083
Stop that.

07:12.125 --> 07:13.208
You're scared?

07:19.416 --> 07:20.333
Pretty much.

07:24.500 --> 07:26.791
Imagine graduate school, right?

07:27.958 --> 07:29.041
It will be hard.

07:31.125 --> 07:32.125
So they say.

07:33.750 --> 07:36.125
Because it will challenge
what we've learned.

07:36.208 --> 07:39.791
- Really?
- Yeah, but it will be exciting.

07:44.083 --> 07:47.333
After graduate school,
will you start your own firm?

07:48.750 --> 07:50.708
Let's get a job first.

07:50.791 --> 07:53.041
Yeah, that's what I meant.
Get a job first.

07:53.125 --> 07:55.208
For a year or two.

07:55.833 --> 08:00.041
Once we've gained the knowledge,
then we can start our own firm.

08:03.958 --> 08:06.333
It won't be easy.

08:07.791 --> 08:09.375
I agree. It won't.

08:11.750 --> 08:14.875
But to imagine doing it with you...

08:16.291 --> 08:17.500
I'm willing to do it.

08:20.208 --> 08:21.166
Me too.

08:33.541 --> 08:36.750
- Hello. Agnes?
<i>- Hello? Maurin?</i>

08:38.791 --> 08:41.458
<i>- Is Moko still in the thesis defense?</i>
- Yes.

08:42.583 --> 08:47.208
<i>Please tell Moko
Atmo had a heart attack.</i>

08:48.166 --> 08:50.625
<i>We're taking him to the hospital.</i>

09:24.625 --> 09:26.166
Atmo.

10:36.291 --> 10:37.333
Sis...

10:39.125 --> 10:40.500
Agnes, what's wrong?

10:42.541 --> 10:43.583
Agnes?

10:44.291 --> 10:45.750
- I'm okay.
- Agnes.

10:47.333 --> 10:48.958
- I'm fine.
- Agnes?

10:49.041 --> 10:50.333
Nurse!

10:51.833 --> 10:53.916
- Mom, are you okay?
- Nurse...

10:54.000 --> 10:56.083
Ano, go get a nurse. Hurry up! Sis.

10:56.166 --> 10:58.500
It's fine. My water broke.

10:58.583 --> 10:59.875
- Thank you.
- Yes.

11:10.250 --> 11:14.000
DEATH CERTIFICATE
NAME: ATMO WILOTO - 45 YEARS OLD

11:14.083 --> 11:15.416
OCCUPATION: ARCHITECT

11:25.333 --> 11:28.291
- Excuse me. Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

11:28.375 --> 11:33.166
Here's your baby sister.
She needs to breastfeed.

11:33.916 --> 11:36.125
- Can I wake up Ms. Agnes?
- Sure.

11:37.250 --> 11:40.333
Excuse me, Ms. Agnes. Ma'am?

11:40.416 --> 11:43.625
- Sis?
- Ma'am, let's try breastfeeding.

11:46.333 --> 11:50.750
Please hold the baby.
I need to check on her. Sorry.

11:50.833 --> 11:51.875
Mom?

11:52.666 --> 11:53.708
- Sis?
- Mom?

11:54.625 --> 11:56.166
- Ms. Agnes?
- Mom?

11:56.250 --> 11:59.541
Ms. Agnes? Ma'am?

11:59.625 --> 12:00.583
What's wrong, Nurse?

12:00.666 --> 12:02.708
Internal bleeding, Doctor. Uterine atony.

12:02.791 --> 12:03.625
Ma'am?

12:06.083 --> 12:07.208
To the treatment room.

12:08.041 --> 12:09.958
Doctor, what's wrong with my sister?

12:10.041 --> 12:12.583
Excuse us. We will explain later.

12:13.166 --> 12:14.208
What is happening?

12:14.916 --> 12:16.750
- Doctor, what's wrong?
- Excuse us.

13:16.500 --> 13:18.208
- We'll get going.
- We'll get going.

13:18.333 --> 13:19.750
- Take care.
- Bye, Ima.

13:29.458 --> 13:31.166
<i>Hi, Mo. What are you doing?</i>

13:31.875 --> 13:35.000
I just put Ima to bed. How about you, Osa?

13:35.083 --> 13:39.250
<i>Me? The usual. Just tidying up.</i>

13:39.916 --> 13:43.291
<i>How's Ima? She's healthy?</i>

13:50.791 --> 13:55.375
<i>What about the other kids?
Nina, Woko, Ano?</i>

13:56.250 --> 13:58.208
<i>Good. They're all fine.</i>

14:01.375 --> 14:02.875
<i>And what about you?</i>

14:05.625 --> 14:07.291
<i>I'm fine, Sis.</i>

14:07.958 --> 14:09.875
<i>You sound exhausted.</i>

14:11.333 --> 14:12.375
<i>Not really.</i>

14:14.666 --> 14:19.333
<i>Hey, there's an update.</i>

14:21.250 --> 14:25.458
<i>Eka really can't abandon his work here.</i>

14:26.291 --> 14:28.750
<i>So we can't come home.</i>

14:30.583 --> 14:31.666
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

14:36.166 --> 14:37.541
Yes, Osa. It's fine.

14:43.416 --> 14:48.708
Right here. So, the faculties
will be integrated in this studio.

14:49.958 --> 14:52.458
They said the project requires networking.

14:54.291 --> 14:55.333
Rin.

14:57.125 --> 14:58.166
I'm sorry, okay?

15:01.250 --> 15:06.041
Since I cancelled my master's program,
you have to go on your own.

15:13.250 --> 15:17.208
If I were you, Moko,
I would've done the same.

15:22.666 --> 15:24.333
I feel bad for you, Rin.

15:25.250 --> 15:27.125
Don't you feel bad for yourself?

15:28.875 --> 15:30.083
Why worry about me?

15:41.333 --> 15:44.458
Moko. Sorry. Ima won't stop crying.

15:46.083 --> 15:47.458
She's looking for Moko.

15:50.166 --> 15:52.875
It's okay. I'm leaving anyway. It's late.

15:58.541 --> 16:01.166
Moko, I'm sorry.
But Ima has been crying for a while.

16:01.250 --> 16:03.166
We don't know what else to do.

16:04.708 --> 16:06.000
It's okay.

16:08.291 --> 16:09.500
I'll go check on Ima now.

16:12.125 --> 16:13.875
I'm heading off now.

16:13.958 --> 16:15.125
- Sorry, Maurin.
- Sorry.

16:15.208 --> 16:16.500
It's okay.

16:16.583 --> 16:17.708
Sorry, Maurin.

16:17.791 --> 16:19.833
- Take care, Maurin.
- Okay. Thanks.

16:26.291 --> 16:27.625
Hi!

16:30.208 --> 16:34.416
Hello. Ima. What is this?

17:41.416 --> 17:44.583
Start with 2.5 million.
If it's okay, we can increase it slowly.

17:44.666 --> 17:47.291
The highest is 3.5 million.
Are you okay with that?

17:48.125 --> 17:49.666
I don't mind, sir.

17:49.750 --> 17:54.416
But if I may ask, how many projects
do you usually handle in a month?

17:55.000 --> 17:56.541
Three to five at the most.

18:03.500 --> 18:06.250
- Will you excuse me for a minute?
- Sure. Go ahead.

18:06.333 --> 18:07.458
Pooping? All right.

18:12.833 --> 18:15.541
Yes. What is that, sweetie?

18:16.083 --> 18:17.375
What is that, Ima?

18:18.166 --> 18:21.416
I'm preparing dinner and food
to snack on. Enjoy. - You too.

18:21.500 --> 18:22.916
Rima.

18:23.500 --> 18:25.291
- Ima, right?
- Yes, Ima.

18:26.958 --> 18:29.333
Everyone here is smart. I feel dumb.

18:29.416 --> 18:31.250
I wish you were here
MESSAGE DELETED

18:31.333 --> 18:33.208
She weighs 7.5 kilograms.

18:33.291 --> 18:35.583
- Okay.
- One second, sweetheart.

18:39.250 --> 18:41.625
- How high?
- It's 39.2 Celsius.

18:41.708 --> 18:44.333
All right. Hold her
for a second, will you?

18:44.416 --> 18:49.916
Okay, just a minute.
Let me take off my shirt first.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.458
I know. I'm sorry.

18:52.291 --> 18:55.916
I know. Scoot over.

18:58.833 --> 19:01.250
I know.

19:15.458 --> 19:19.666
You can't do this. There are
many people who want to be drafters.

19:19.791 --> 19:22.541
If you hand in your work late like this,
it will be on me.

19:22.625 --> 19:26.333
- I'm sorry. My niece was sick yesterday--
- I get your situation.

19:27.291 --> 19:29.875
But I can't use that excuse
with the client.

19:29.958 --> 19:31.958
You promised to be on time, right?

19:33.541 --> 19:36.375
Sir, give me one more chance.
it won't happen again--

19:36.458 --> 19:39.916
Sorry. I have to replace you.
Sorry, Mo.

19:46.416 --> 19:47.458
I understand, sir.

19:48.791 --> 19:50.583
And once again, I apologize.

19:51.875 --> 19:53.500
I should go now.

19:54.333 --> 19:55.291
Okay.

19:58.250 --> 19:59.291
Let's go.

20:01.375 --> 20:02.625
Did you just get fired?

20:06.166 --> 20:09.166
Just our luck.

20:09.250 --> 20:10.500
Ano.

20:10.583 --> 20:12.208
This iced tea costs 40,000.

20:13.625 --> 20:15.250
It's okay, Ano.

20:16.333 --> 20:17.625
Let's just walk?

20:33.416 --> 20:37.583
<i>When we open our own studio,
the vision should be like this too.</i>

20:38.916 --> 20:42.666
<i>So we don't have to be
all futuristic and minimalist.</i>

20:43.500 --> 20:46.000
<i>-We can just--</i>
- Maurin?

20:46.083 --> 20:47.125
<i>Yes?</i>

20:48.375 --> 20:49.416
<i>Yes, Mo?</i>

20:53.333 --> 20:55.250
- What if we break up?
<i>- Mo?</i>

21:04.458 --> 21:05.958
<i>Sorry, what do you mean?</i>

21:11.166 --> 21:12.500
I want us to break up.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.291
<i>Moko, wait a minute...</i>

21:26.375 --> 21:29.958
Maurin, being with me
means taking care of four children

21:30.041 --> 21:31.500
and that's just impossible.

21:32.666 --> 21:35.625
<i>- I'm okay with that--</i>
- Owning a firm is impossible.

21:35.708 --> 21:39.250
It's impossible. And you don't understand
my situation here.

21:39.916 --> 21:43.916
<i>Okay. Tell me, then!
You never tell me.</i>

21:44.000 --> 21:45.750
Because I can't tell you!

21:47.458 --> 21:49.750
I have no time.
How can we start a business?

21:54.083 --> 21:56.250
There's so much
you can achieve in your life.

21:58.166 --> 22:01.000
But that won't happen
if you're stuck with me.

22:02.958 --> 22:04.583
You have to be realistic, Rin.

22:08.083 --> 22:10.625
All right. Let's do it, Mo.
Let's be realistic.

22:11.208 --> 22:12.666
<i>Let's think about it together.</i>

22:12.750 --> 22:15.041
- I can't even draft, Rin.
<i>- Mo...</i>

22:16.958 --> 22:19.416
I can't even create a draft.

22:21.583 --> 22:25.541
And I have to find
other jobs outside of architecture.

22:33.500 --> 22:37.125
All right, then.
I will bathe Ima now, so that she...

22:38.666 --> 22:39.583
I'm signing out.

23:06.916 --> 23:07.875
<i>Mo?</i>

23:11.166 --> 23:12.208
<i>Mo?</i>

24:25.958 --> 24:28.416
But you wanted...
Here, let's wipe you first.

24:30.208 --> 24:33.208
Good girl. Here goes.

24:36.833 --> 24:38.750
Tasty, huh?

24:45.875 --> 24:48.750
- Bali.
- Look, it's Bali.

24:49.791 --> 24:51.375
We're going to Kuta.

24:52.250 --> 24:56.708
- That spoils the whole thing.
- What are you saying?

25:05.000 --> 25:05.916
Excuse me, sir.

25:23.625 --> 25:28.916
I want to stress that Nina
is an exceptionally accomplished student.

25:29.541 --> 25:30.583
Thank you.

25:30.666 --> 25:33.125
<i>Woko is actually quite smart.</i>

25:33.750 --> 25:36.166
However, he tends to goof around a lot.

25:36.250 --> 25:39.500
Looking at the grades,
it's very concerning.

25:39.583 --> 25:44.250
I hope the family can pay attention
to Rivano's studies.

25:44.333 --> 25:45.916
He needs to improve.

26:18.333 --> 26:19.875
All right.

26:29.625 --> 26:30.458
<i>Ima!</i>

26:42.291 --> 26:45.875
Moko. Move it there.

26:46.583 --> 26:48.458
When was our last vacation?

26:48.583 --> 26:52.500
- How can we do that, Woko?
- We can barely pay our electricity bill.

26:54.791 --> 26:58.708
I'll glue your mouth shut.
I'm serious.

26:59.833 --> 27:03.291
- So you won't be able to eat duck meat.
- Don't do that.

27:06.083 --> 27:09.250
Let's look at our house. After vacation...

27:09.333 --> 27:12.416
- Can we see our house from there?
- Of course we can.

27:24.875 --> 27:25.833
Let us see, Wo.

27:46.416 --> 27:47.916
Which one do you want?

27:48.291 --> 27:52.416
Yellow? This one, okay?
Here. Let me get it for you. Let's try.

27:57.083 --> 27:57.916
Sir?

27:58.000 --> 27:59.416
Please accept it, Moko.

28:01.791 --> 28:05.250
- I beg you.
- Sir, there's no need for this.

28:05.333 --> 28:07.625
Trust me, Moko.

28:07.708 --> 28:11.000
After one month...
After everything is ready,

28:11.083 --> 28:13.916
I will come back and get Gadis.

28:14.500 --> 28:15.458
Okay?

28:16.583 --> 28:18.541
It's not that I don't want to help.

28:18.625 --> 28:21.291
But I'm taking care
of my four nephews and nieces.

28:21.375 --> 28:23.375
Help me, please, Moko.

28:23.458 --> 28:24.750
I'm so sorry, I can't.

28:24.833 --> 28:26.666
I beg you, Moko.

28:26.750 --> 28:28.666
It's not that I don't want to help.

28:28.750 --> 28:32.791
Help me, Moko, please.
Moko, I promise.

28:32.875 --> 28:35.666
- I'll come back.
- Sir, this is unnecessary.

28:35.750 --> 28:38.541
- Sir, I understand--
- I promise.

28:38.625 --> 28:41.416
- It's not that--
- I promise I won't be a burden!

28:52.416 --> 28:55.916
Yeah, I can cook.

28:56.708 --> 28:58.125
I can do laundry too.

29:02.416 --> 29:05.541
I promise I will be good

29:05.625 --> 29:07.375
and I won't be a burden...

29:08.166 --> 29:09.125
at all.

29:15.333 --> 29:16.708
She's been outside?

29:18.833 --> 29:19.875
Yes.

29:22.125 --> 29:23.083
Moko?

29:24.916 --> 29:28.166
Can I stay? I'll help out.

29:28.916 --> 29:31.958
Ais, just come in.

29:32.041 --> 29:35.416
Come in. Here, I'll help you.

29:37.541 --> 29:38.375
Come on in.

29:39.291 --> 29:41.125
- Please sit down, Is.
- Okay.

29:44.708 --> 29:48.041
Come on in. Sit down.

29:50.166 --> 29:51.500
Thank you, Moko.

29:54.708 --> 29:55.750
This is Ima.

29:56.291 --> 30:01.291
Oh, yes. Hello, Ima.

30:01.375 --> 30:03.625
- This is Ais.
- Hi.

30:03.708 --> 30:04.791
<i>Are you sure, Moko?</i>

30:08.750 --> 30:10.208
- No.
- What?

30:11.708 --> 30:13.833
So why did you say yes?

30:15.041 --> 30:16.500
I had no choice, Wo.

30:18.458 --> 30:20.666
You could've just politely refused.

30:23.083 --> 30:25.166
Can we afford to have Ais here?

30:26.958 --> 30:28.125
He gave you money?

30:32.791 --> 30:34.375
Our money is running out.

30:35.583 --> 30:38.833
I've also been freelancing
for the past two years.

30:38.916 --> 30:41.833
The money he gave us
can help with school fees.

30:46.833 --> 30:48.791
I need to look for a proper job.

30:50.083 --> 30:54.625
To maintain this house,
and your college fund. I want you to--

30:54.708 --> 30:58.750
College is not a priority.
I can postpone it.

31:00.458 --> 31:02.375
Besides...

31:03.000 --> 31:07.750
if I go to college and you work,
who's going to look after Ima?

31:09.166 --> 31:10.208
Ano?

31:15.333 --> 31:19.291
Next year. Okay, Wo?
I will try to put you in college.

31:20.708 --> 31:24.375
About Ima, I'll figure something out.

31:26.333 --> 31:27.375
Let's be hopeful.

31:28.750 --> 31:29.708
Taste this.

31:36.916 --> 31:39.375
Taste it.

31:50.916 --> 31:52.125
Be careful.

31:57.166 --> 31:58.833
So everyone can get some?

32:02.000 --> 32:03.041
Come and eat!

32:07.625 --> 32:09.625
Looks like they're having fun.

32:20.833 --> 32:22.916
Food is ready. <i>Tempe orek.</i>

32:23.500 --> 32:24.458
Okay.

32:26.666 --> 32:28.666
Ais is good at it, isn't she?

32:31.291 --> 32:33.625
Yay. Play some more.

32:35.583 --> 32:39.000
What song? Any requests?

32:39.083 --> 32:42.625
- Do you know <i>"Jangan Risaukan"?
- "Jangan Risaukan"?</i>

32:44.291 --> 32:45.250
That's the one.

32:45.333 --> 32:48.791
- The intro...
- Try it.

32:52.208 --> 32:55.375
- That's the one!
- That's right.

32:56.041 --> 32:57.416
- Try it.
- Okay.

33:23.125 --> 33:24.208
I remember!

33:36.125 --> 33:37.916
So what do we say to Ais?

33:38.000 --> 33:42.458
I will talk to Ais later.
I have an interview. Wish me luck.

33:42.541 --> 33:43.583
For sure.

33:44.333 --> 33:46.125
Okay, then. Here, Wo.

33:47.458 --> 33:49.166
Hanoby. "Handover of the Baby."

33:50.041 --> 33:54.208
- Here. With Woko.
- With me, okay?

33:55.083 --> 33:57.625
- Be good.
- Bye, Ima!

33:57.708 --> 34:04.083
Bye, Ima!

34:04.166 --> 34:05.166
Bye!

34:08.041 --> 34:09.375
Bye. Wave again.

34:09.458 --> 34:12.041
- Bye! Again.
- Bye.

34:12.833 --> 34:16.666
Still? Till how far
should we wave goodbye?

34:17.250 --> 34:19.791
- Bye, Ima!
- Bye!

34:20.291 --> 34:22.583
Bye, Woko.

34:23.583 --> 34:24.416
Bye!

34:29.416 --> 34:30.375
Bye!

34:50.333 --> 34:51.375
But I'm curious.

34:51.458 --> 34:55.375
That gap after you graduated?
Why did you wait a few years?

34:56.916 --> 35:00.000
I happen to have a baby niece, sir.

35:00.875 --> 35:01.875
Okay.

35:02.000 --> 35:05.083
During that gap,
I was taking care of my baby niece.

35:06.041 --> 35:07.291
Okay.

35:08.083 --> 35:09.750
Rin, is it done?

35:10.583 --> 35:12.166
- One second, please.
- Okay.

35:14.166 --> 35:15.291
Okay.

35:38.666 --> 35:40.083
- Here you go.
- Okay.

35:41.750 --> 35:46.083
Is he being interviewed
for the new drafter position?

35:46.250 --> 35:47.625
Yes, he is.

35:49.083 --> 35:50.583
- Thank you.
- Yes.

35:56.500 --> 35:57.916
- Yes, sir, but--
- No!

35:58.000 --> 36:00.333
I understand you have work experience.

36:00.416 --> 36:03.000
But we have a system here. We have rules.

36:03.083 --> 36:08.041
If the client complaints, how can I
back you up if you don't follow the rules?

36:08.125 --> 36:09.208
Sir, sorry.

36:09.291 --> 36:10.916
Maurin, hang on. I'm in a meeting.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.166
Yes? You understand what I mean, right?

36:13.250 --> 36:14.625
Sorry, but this is urgent.

36:14.708 --> 36:17.541
Now, walk me through the work.
I want to take a look.

36:17.625 --> 36:20.333
Come on! Open the laptop.

36:20.416 --> 36:22.541
You need another junior architect, right?

36:22.625 --> 36:23.583
Yes.

36:23.666 --> 36:27.041
Bayu's drafter is applying
to be a full time employee.

36:27.125 --> 36:30.416
I know him very well.
And in my opinion...

36:30.500 --> 36:33.083
it would be a waste
if he's only hired as a drafter.

36:33.166 --> 36:35.416
Can we talk later? I'm in a meeting!

36:35.500 --> 36:37.541
He's the one you're looking for.

36:40.875 --> 36:41.833
I'm sorry.

36:43.125 --> 36:45.416
<i>So, can you focus on work now?</i>

36:46.083 --> 36:47.125
Full time, yes.

36:52.583 --> 36:54.291
Let's see over here.

36:58.291 --> 37:00.083
- Mr. Alif, sorry.
- Yes?

37:00.166 --> 37:04.500
Mr. Sam said that Mr. Moko could be
considered for the junior architect role.

37:06.500 --> 37:10.708
Okay, but I have to reinterview him.

37:11.625 --> 37:12.666
Can you do it, Moko?

37:13.500 --> 37:14.750
Yes, I can.

37:14.833 --> 37:16.000
- Thank you.
- Of course.

37:17.583 --> 37:18.875
- Excuse me, sir.
- Sure.

37:26.000 --> 37:29.375
Sorry, didn't we agree yesterday
not to tell Mr. Sam yet?

37:30.166 --> 37:34.166
Yes, but Bayu said
I can talk directly to Mr. Sam.

37:35.166 --> 37:39.291
But if it continues,
it'll be difficult for you in the future.

37:39.375 --> 37:43.166
Yes, I understand. I'm sorry.

37:43.958 --> 37:47.083
It's okay.
Next time, please tell me first.

37:57.708 --> 37:59.125
You work here?

38:01.333 --> 38:02.291
Yes.

38:10.583 --> 38:13.291
- Care for a tour?
- Sure. Let's go.

38:20.708 --> 38:21.958
Mr. Sam is a lecturer, Mo.

38:22.041 --> 38:25.958
So he really appreciates it
when people here always want to learn.

38:28.083 --> 38:31.958
- Did Mr. Alif give you a task?
- Yes.

38:32.833 --> 38:35.541
But it's unusual
that you can do it at home.

38:37.666 --> 38:39.916
That's actually Mr. Sam's trick.

38:41.000 --> 38:44.083
During the presentation,
he would be able to tell

38:44.166 --> 38:45.916
if it was your work or not.

38:50.666 --> 38:55.541
When I was evaluated
for the junior architect role,

38:55.625 --> 38:57.208
he also used that design.

38:58.958 --> 39:01.500
Because that was
Mr. Sam's first project design.

39:01.583 --> 39:02.541
Oh, yeah?

39:06.833 --> 39:09.458
Mo, are you still using your old laptop?

39:10.125 --> 39:11.375
From college?

39:12.625 --> 39:13.583
I am.

39:16.541 --> 39:19.166
The latest version
of Rhino is really heavy.

39:20.541 --> 39:23.583
You can borrow my laptop if you want.

39:23.666 --> 39:26.791
No. I'm planning to buy a new one
this afternoon anyway.

39:26.875 --> 39:28.458
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

39:29.041 --> 39:30.875
- You have time for that?
- Yes.

39:30.958 --> 39:35.416
It was my plan because I have to...

39:35.500 --> 39:40.166
It's fine. It's just that Mr. Sam
will scold me if you can't finish it.

39:41.791 --> 39:44.833
- But that's okay.
- Hang on, "Scold you"?

39:46.250 --> 39:47.291
No, it's fine.

39:49.666 --> 39:51.083
How are the kids?

40:11.583 --> 40:13.166
<i>Ima plays by herself now.</i>

40:14.416 --> 40:15.833
She's two years old now.

40:19.333 --> 40:20.541
The transition period.

40:23.250 --> 40:24.500
Transition period?

40:30.041 --> 40:32.083
<i>She used to be fully dependent on me.</i>

40:32.708 --> 40:34.583
<i>But now she knows what she wants.</i>

40:35.208 --> 40:38.125
<i>That's why she often throws
tantrums and gets frustrated.</i>

40:42.208 --> 40:44.000
What about Nina?

40:46.083 --> 40:47.125
Nina?

40:50.375 --> 40:54.416
Where have you been?

40:54.500 --> 40:57.791
- Shut up!
- I'm asking you a question. Na!

40:57.875 --> 40:59.666
We were all worried about you.

41:00.833 --> 41:02.208
Where have you been?

41:08.666 --> 41:10.916
Where, Na? You should have let us know.

41:13.416 --> 41:15.666
Na, I kept calling,
but you didn't answer.

41:15.750 --> 41:18.291
- Na! Where--
- Stop it! You're not my father!

41:19.750 --> 41:21.750
<i>Recently I had a fight with Nina.</i>

41:21.833 --> 41:24.833
<i>She came home late. Then I scolded her.</i>

41:37.791 --> 41:40.000
Got dumped? Nina?

41:43.625 --> 41:45.791
And it was recorded. That's insane.

41:46.500 --> 41:47.625
How could he?

41:47.708 --> 41:51.708
Turns out she just got dumped
and it was recorded.

41:52.625 --> 41:54.458
- Really?
- Yeah. Cruel, isn't it?

42:00.333 --> 42:01.791
I'm sorry.

42:04.916 --> 42:07.750
I only found out yesterday
about what happened to you.

42:11.708 --> 42:13.250
I also apologize...

42:14.000 --> 42:18.333
for making you feel like
I'm controlling you.

42:25.208 --> 42:27.416
I should be the one apologizing, Moko.

42:30.916 --> 42:32.125
No.

42:33.166 --> 42:34.708
I should've understood.

42:46.625 --> 42:48.166
They're really mean.

42:49.333 --> 42:51.125
They plotted to trick me.

42:55.625 --> 42:57.375
<i>Actually, I...</i>

42:58.166 --> 43:01.750
<i>To be someone that she can talk to...</i>

43:02.333 --> 43:06.333
<i>it made me happy.
It must've been hard to be in her shoes.</i>

43:11.458 --> 43:14.166
How is Woko doing?

43:17.041 --> 43:18.791
He has sacrificed the most.

43:38.666 --> 43:41.583
<i>He works as a driver
so Nina can go to college.</i>

43:42.541 --> 43:45.416
He really wanted to go to college too.
Law school.

43:45.958 --> 43:49.708
But for his younger siblings,
he's willing to forget his dream.

43:54.000 --> 43:55.750
What about Ano?

44:03.208 --> 44:07.125
Ano said he wants to be an architect.

44:07.208 --> 44:09.166
Because he was inspired by Atmo.

44:10.458 --> 44:12.666
- Seriously?
- Cool, right?

44:15.875 --> 44:17.583
There's one more story, Rin.

44:19.666 --> 44:23.166
My childhood piano teacher
came to my house.

44:23.875 --> 44:25.708
He entrusted his daughter to me.

44:26.208 --> 44:27.750
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

44:27.833 --> 44:29.416
He said he won't be long.

44:29.500 --> 44:32.458
A month or so,
while he prepared everything,

44:32.541 --> 44:34.750
so Ais can join him.

44:35.458 --> 44:37.708
Her name is Gadis, we call her "Ais."

44:38.875 --> 44:40.375
She's a very nice girl, Rin.

44:42.791 --> 44:45.125
- So--
- Here's the flash disk.

44:47.708 --> 44:49.583
And, Maurin, Mr. Sam's asking for you.

44:50.291 --> 44:52.541
Yeah, I'll be there. Thank you.

44:55.583 --> 44:58.333
Okay, then. Keep your spirits up.

44:59.541 --> 45:01.333
Let me know if you need anything.

45:01.416 --> 45:02.458
Okay.

45:03.166 --> 45:04.541
- I should go.
- Okay.

45:23.833 --> 45:27.958
- Excuse me, Miss? Which way is the exit?
- Over there.

45:29.083 --> 45:30.708
Yes, sir, that's right.

45:30.791 --> 45:35.583
I am interested in buying your laptop
because I know you're an architect. Yes.

45:35.666 --> 45:39.833
You want payment on the spot? Okay.
Just send the time and location.

45:40.375 --> 45:42.458
Yes. Thank you, sir.

45:49.416 --> 45:51.625
Moko!

45:52.166 --> 45:54.125
Ano said he's having a stomachache.

45:54.208 --> 45:55.291
What's wrong?

45:55.375 --> 45:58.875
- It feels like needles piercing.
- Needles?

46:02.875 --> 46:05.833
Based on the blood test
and ultrasound results

46:05.916 --> 46:07.916
he can be treated on an outpatient basis.

46:08.583 --> 46:13.250
But we would like to monitor him
until the IV is done, okay?

46:14.125 --> 46:15.875
- Thanks, Doctor.
- You're welcome.

46:22.333 --> 46:23.958
The IV bag is still full?

46:30.750 --> 46:31.791
<i>Sir?</i>

46:32.333 --> 46:37.416
Your National Health Insurance payments
have been overdue for two years.

46:37.500 --> 46:40.166
For the moment,
we're unable to process it.

46:41.333 --> 46:44.166
Right. If I may know,

46:44.250 --> 46:47.333
how much will it cost
without the insurance?

46:49.791 --> 46:52.916
It's Rp 2,852,000 in total.

46:54.333 --> 46:56.291
Bank transfer or debit card?

46:57.416 --> 46:58.958
Give me a moment.

46:59.041 --> 47:02.333
- Okay. Here, sir.
- Thank you.

47:05.833 --> 47:06.791
Sir.

47:10.041 --> 47:10.875
Sir.

47:12.125 --> 47:14.541
I'm sorry, I don't think
I can buy the laptop.

47:14.625 --> 47:18.250
Why? It's not everyday you can find
a MacBook at such a great price.

47:18.333 --> 47:19.833
It has the M1 chip.

47:19.916 --> 47:22.041
Whatever app you want to install,
I can wait.

47:22.125 --> 47:24.208
Just try, it will definitely run smoothly.

47:24.291 --> 47:26.166
The battery is still at more than 90%.

47:26.250 --> 47:29.041
You can use it all day, no problem.

47:29.125 --> 47:31.625
And it's really light, only 1.29 kg.

47:31.708 --> 47:33.958
You can get the scale and check.
I'm not lying.

47:34.041 --> 47:36.583
- You can check the status. It's all good.
- Look...

47:36.666 --> 47:41.958
The reason I'm canceling...

47:42.500 --> 47:43.875
is because...

47:45.083 --> 47:46.000
my nephew is sick.

47:47.291 --> 47:49.250
Enteritis. I'm handling the bill now.

47:51.250 --> 47:53.666
I hope he gets better soon.

47:53.750 --> 47:56.291
But this hospital is good.

47:56.375 --> 47:58.916
I remember when I was treated here.

47:59.000 --> 48:03.125
This hospital is excellent.
They are meticulous.

48:03.208 --> 48:06.041
The Emergency Room
is very efficiently structured.

48:06.125 --> 48:08.833
The machines' specifications
are also no joke.

48:08.916 --> 48:12.125
I didn't check the Wi-Fi,
but you can do it later.

48:12.208 --> 48:15.833
- The signal was 5G on my cellphone.
- Right.

48:15.916 --> 48:19.666
So this hospital
is a good choice, don't worry.

48:19.750 --> 48:21.000
- I was satisfied.
- Yes.

48:21.083 --> 48:24.291
I know this hospital is great.
That's why it's expensive.

48:24.375 --> 48:27.666
Price is relative.
The point is to get well, right?

48:27.750 --> 48:31.250
I forget how much it was
because I used insurance.

48:31.333 --> 48:33.291
I forget how much the bill was.

48:33.375 --> 48:37.500
It was worth it. With insurance,
we're only paying Rp 100,000 per month.

48:37.583 --> 48:42.625
I was treated here for about
three or four days, but the bill...

48:45.416 --> 48:47.416
Why did you end up with enteritis?

48:47.500 --> 48:48.541
Woko...

48:48.625 --> 48:50.250
He ate too much fried food.

48:50.333 --> 48:54.250
- All that oil must have built up.
- Enough.

48:54.333 --> 48:56.208
- Here.
- Thank you, Ais.

48:56.291 --> 49:01.250
- Take your medicine after eating.
- Okay.

49:01.333 --> 49:03.458
But don't eat fried food anymore.

49:04.500 --> 49:05.458
Okay.

49:08.166 --> 49:09.916
- Can I take a look too?
- Sure.

49:11.041 --> 49:13.375
Can you still use the old laptop?

49:13.458 --> 49:16.250
I can,
but I have to use a different software.

49:16.333 --> 49:17.958
A lighter one.

49:18.041 --> 49:19.791
- But is everything okay?
- All good.

49:22.541 --> 49:23.875
Now I will make it...

49:30.083 --> 49:31.291
Oh, no!

49:34.541 --> 49:35.916
What else can I do?

49:36.000 --> 49:37.625
I need to go to the bathroom.

49:39.375 --> 49:41.541
- Ano, take the medicine.
- Okay.

49:46.708 --> 49:48.375
Who was that, Is?

49:48.458 --> 49:50.708
- Maurin.
- Oh, Maurin.

49:51.666 --> 49:53.166
It's okay, I'll pick it up.

49:53.250 --> 49:55.166
- Should I get Moko?
- No need.

49:56.625 --> 49:57.833
Hello, Maurin?

49:58.583 --> 50:01.000
- A lot, still?
- Does it always take so long?

50:01.083 --> 50:03.708
- Yeah.
- Here's your coffee.

50:03.791 --> 50:05.791
Yes, thank you.

50:05.875 --> 50:08.333
Ais made coffee faster
than you moving a pillar.

50:09.583 --> 50:11.291
- What's the matter?
- Woko...

50:11.375 --> 50:15.208
Even if it's slow, if we're patient...

50:15.666 --> 50:16.708
Why is it doing that?

50:17.458 --> 50:18.416
Oh, no.

50:18.500 --> 50:19.750
Oh, no!

50:23.333 --> 50:27.291
Ais, boil some water.
Make more coffee for Moko.

50:28.791 --> 50:30.208
it's going to take long.

50:31.500 --> 50:34.250
I have to buy more coffee,
this is the last one.

50:34.333 --> 50:37.000
Just use the dregs from that one.

50:37.083 --> 50:39.333
He won't finish and will get acid reflux.

50:40.666 --> 50:41.708
Oh, dear.

51:00.250 --> 51:02.375
Even the sound is different.

51:03.083 --> 51:04.916
It's a distinctive sound.

51:06.041 --> 51:09.833
Is it done, No? Let me see.

51:13.625 --> 51:15.083
You're pretty warm.

51:16.958 --> 51:20.333
Are you warm? Yes, you are.

51:20.958 --> 51:24.333
Eat the porridge first.
After that, take your medicine.

51:25.041 --> 51:26.333
Thank you...

51:27.375 --> 51:29.208
for coming to help Moko.

51:29.291 --> 51:30.750
No problem, No.

51:31.666 --> 51:36.125
These nuts here, don't eat them.
Just eat soft food for now.

51:37.958 --> 51:40.000
But after you chew it, it becomes soft.

51:42.250 --> 51:44.208
That's not how it works, Ano.

51:48.791 --> 51:50.041
I can't imagine.

51:51.291 --> 51:53.625
If you didn't come...

51:56.291 --> 51:57.541
I feel bad for Moko.

51:59.500 --> 52:02.166
The laptop kept restarting.

52:03.291 --> 52:04.583
It's a very old laptop.

52:07.916 --> 52:09.166
Next time...

52:10.583 --> 52:14.250
if I get sick... I won't say anything.

52:18.666 --> 52:20.750
I'll endure it as long as I can...

52:22.166 --> 52:23.708
so Moko won't be burdened.

52:27.416 --> 52:28.750
I feel bad for him.

53:52.416 --> 53:56.000
Just like in college.
Didn't sleep to finish assignments.

53:56.083 --> 53:59.083
No time for a shower,
but it's time to rush to campus.

54:01.500 --> 54:04.458
Sorry that you had to take care of Ano.

54:06.500 --> 54:07.791
It's okay, Mo.

54:09.125 --> 54:13.333
- I just don't want to be a burden to you.
- No. It's okay.

54:15.041 --> 54:16.416
Enough.

54:16.500 --> 54:19.666
You better think
about the presentation to Mr. Sam.

54:22.958 --> 54:24.833
What kind of person is Mr. Sam?

54:24.916 --> 54:27.583
Will he ask technical questions?

54:28.833 --> 54:31.083
Why are you smiling? Rin, I'm serious.

54:31.875 --> 54:32.833
Maurin?

54:34.333 --> 54:36.750
Rin?

54:40.958 --> 54:42.416
But this is cute, right?

54:42.500 --> 54:43.583
Ima will like it.

54:43.666 --> 54:44.791
Here, Ais...

54:44.875 --> 54:45.916
Cute, right?

54:46.583 --> 54:49.875
Please help me with this.
It's Moko's. It has to be perfect.

54:57.208 --> 54:58.583
I got the job.

55:00.958 --> 55:02.041
You are so cool.

55:03.791 --> 55:06.583
We didn't make him
one liter of coffee for nothing.

55:06.666 --> 55:08.708
Ais' hand was sore from stirring.

55:09.500 --> 55:10.666
Almost got acid reflux!

55:10.750 --> 55:12.541
From making too much coffee.

55:12.625 --> 55:13.666
Osa?

55:15.625 --> 55:17.458
- Moko!
- Osa.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.875
Sorry I couldn't come home earlier.

55:22.958 --> 55:25.916
- It's okay. When did you arrive?
- This afternoon.

55:26.000 --> 55:27.958
How are you? You got a job?

55:28.625 --> 55:29.583
Congratulations.

55:30.708 --> 55:32.666
- Sa?
- Yes, honey?

55:32.750 --> 55:35.375
- Have you heated my food?
- Yes. One moment, please.

55:36.208 --> 55:38.000
- Is that Moko?
- Yes.

55:40.666 --> 55:43.458
Moko, heating up food is simple, isn't it?

55:45.375 --> 55:49.250
Hot meal or not, not a problem.
Especially if it's from someone.

55:49.583 --> 55:50.958
Huh?

55:53.875 --> 55:55.875
- You meant these?
- Yes...

55:55.958 --> 56:00.541
I bought this
to celebrate me getting hired.

56:00.625 --> 56:03.250
Can I eat it with rice?
It can be a side dish.

56:03.333 --> 56:06.416
- No. That's <i>martabak...</i>
- Congratulations.

56:08.000 --> 56:08.833
Thank you, Nina.

56:11.291 --> 56:13.541
- Moko?
<i>- Kak.</i>

56:15.583 --> 56:17.333
Long time no see.

56:17.416 --> 56:20.000
- You're good?
- I'm good.

56:20.083 --> 56:21.375
You've become skinnier.

56:23.750 --> 56:26.208
I heard you just got a job?

56:27.208 --> 56:30.500
That's good. A steady job is a must.

56:30.583 --> 56:32.458
Don't do freelance work.

56:34.250 --> 56:35.291
How's your salary?

56:36.500 --> 56:38.708
How much is your salary?

56:41.125 --> 56:44.250
If you're not comfortable,
you don't need to answer.

56:44.333 --> 56:48.458
But if you're just starting a job,
how much can you earn anyway?

56:50.125 --> 56:51.166
Eight million.

56:51.750 --> 56:55.000
Eight million? That's not bad.

56:55.083 --> 56:58.166
That was how much I got
when I first started working.

56:58.791 --> 57:00.708
But that was 10 years ago.

57:00.791 --> 57:03.250
Ten years ago, it was a lot.

57:03.333 --> 57:07.000
But it's not bad for now.
That's a good start.

57:10.666 --> 57:12.250
Why do you look troubled?

57:14.666 --> 57:16.500
Because the project is in Anyer.

57:18.500 --> 57:19.583
And?

57:19.666 --> 57:21.333
It's far from...

57:21.875 --> 57:25.750
Oh, yeah. I understand.

57:26.916 --> 57:30.250
But now you have me.

57:31.000 --> 57:32.291
Osa is also here.

57:32.375 --> 57:34.625
So you don't need to worry
about the house.

57:34.708 --> 57:38.125
Don't worry about it.
I can take care of it.

57:39.708 --> 57:41.583
Just focus on your work.

57:41.666 --> 57:43.458
Well, but...

57:43.541 --> 57:44.500
Yes?

57:44.583 --> 57:49.041
I want to make eggs.
You prefer a sunny side up or omelet?

57:49.125 --> 57:51.833
Omelet, of course.
I've never liked sunny side ups.

57:51.916 --> 57:54.750
- Wait, make one for him too.
- Do you want egg?

57:54.833 --> 57:55.875
What do you like?

57:55.958 --> 57:57.500
- I have eaten...
- It's okay.

57:57.583 --> 57:59.333
Just an omelette. He likes it.

57:59.416 --> 58:02.041
- I've already eaten.
- Make him an omelette.

58:02.125 --> 58:03.166
- What?
- Omelette.

58:03.250 --> 58:05.666
Yes, omelette. For the others too. Okay.

58:09.000 --> 58:10.833
Okay, then.

58:11.583 --> 58:15.666
I suggest you take the job in Anyer.

58:16.208 --> 58:18.291
Take it, okay?

58:18.375 --> 58:19.916
You rest first.

58:20.000 --> 58:21.125
Sit.

58:21.208 --> 58:23.708
I brought a lot of things. There. Okay?

58:23.791 --> 58:26.041
- Show them to Moko, okay?
- Yes.

58:26.125 --> 58:27.750
- Thank you, Eka.
- Sure.

58:32.541 --> 58:33.583
Ano?

58:34.375 --> 58:35.500
What?

58:35.583 --> 58:37.916
That's red velvet <i>martabak,</i> No.

58:38.000 --> 58:40.250
Red usually means good luck.

58:42.583 --> 58:43.416
It's good.

58:49.958 --> 58:53.708
What? Want one? There's a lot in the back.

58:55.166 --> 58:56.500
- Weird stomach.
- Whatever.

58:59.458 --> 59:01.375
This is like mango sticky rice.

59:03.250 --> 59:04.708
From Thailand.

59:05.625 --> 59:07.250
He really ate it, Mo?

59:07.333 --> 59:10.833
Yes, he really ate it.
It was red velvet <i>martabak</i> too.

59:10.916 --> 59:13.000
Ano!

59:14.625 --> 59:16.166
So, it's a full house now, Mo?

59:17.750 --> 59:23.041
Eka and Osa are sleeping in Atmo's room,
where I usually sleep with Ima.

59:25.708 --> 59:28.000
So, you're sleeping
in the front room again?

59:28.083 --> 59:29.458
- Yes.
- With Ima?

59:29.541 --> 59:33.375
No, Ima and Nina sleep
in Nina's room, along with Ais.

59:37.625 --> 59:38.958
The timing's perfect.

59:40.041 --> 59:41.958
Eka and Osa are back home.

59:43.416 --> 59:44.708
Maybe this is fate?

59:49.083 --> 59:51.416
So I get to have my own life.

01:00:05.125 --> 01:00:06.500
Why does it feel strange?

01:00:10.333 --> 01:00:13.500
To think that I can have my own life...

01:00:16.041 --> 01:00:17.458
why does it feel wrong?

01:00:23.833 --> 01:00:25.083
It's not strange, Mo.

01:00:27.791 --> 01:00:29.416
I understand how you feel.

01:00:34.083 --> 01:00:37.833
I know how it feels
to prioritize yourself...

01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:42.416
and feel guilty about it.

01:00:46.750 --> 01:00:48.583
When you had to be the father...

01:00:51.041 --> 01:00:52.125
to those children...

01:00:54.708 --> 01:00:58.333
And then
you didn't continue your education.

01:01:01.625 --> 01:01:04.125
You've dedicated your time
to take care of them.

01:01:07.208 --> 01:01:08.583
There was a time...

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.375
when I hated myself so much.

01:01:16.666 --> 01:01:18.625
I hated myself because I thought...

01:01:20.416 --> 01:01:24.333
that your priority was us.

01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:29.083
But it turned out
that your priority was the children.

01:01:34.625 --> 01:01:37.583
I really hated it every time
it crossed my mind.

01:01:41.083 --> 01:01:44.666
It made me feel like
I was a horrible person.

01:01:47.958 --> 01:01:51.333
I felt selfish.

01:01:56.083 --> 01:01:57.208
And then you...

01:02:01.083 --> 01:02:02.041
We broke up.

01:02:10.666 --> 01:02:12.125
I'm sorry, Rin.

01:03:01.833 --> 01:03:02.875
<i>Oh, right.</i>

01:03:04.625 --> 01:03:05.666
Mr. Albert...

01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:09.125
he gave out vouchers, Mo.

01:03:09.208 --> 01:03:10.583
To stay at his resort.

01:03:15.458 --> 01:03:16.666
Let's take the kids.

01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:21.958
Come on. Let's all go.

01:03:23.166 --> 01:03:25.625
The cottage can
accommodate them. Seriously.

01:03:26.791 --> 01:03:29.666
We also have to evaluate the old resort.

01:03:30.208 --> 01:03:33.500
So, when we build the new one,
we know how it should be.

01:03:35.166 --> 01:03:36.208
Am I right?

01:03:37.250 --> 01:03:41.166
You said it'd be good for Ima.
For her sensory skills.

01:03:41.791 --> 01:03:45.666
It's good for her to walk on the sand
and play in the sea.

01:03:48.541 --> 01:03:52.583
You mentioned texture.

01:03:54.666 --> 01:03:56.416
So she won't be a picky eater.

01:04:00.291 --> 01:04:03.291
Besides, it's been a while
since they went on a holiday.

01:04:07.416 --> 01:04:08.458
Take them, okay?

01:04:13.166 --> 01:04:14.750
Thank you, Rin.

01:04:57.500 --> 01:05:00.208
Look at that. Over there!

01:05:38.291 --> 01:05:40.708
<i>Thank you for taking us on this holiday.</i>

01:05:42.333 --> 01:05:43.875
You should thank Maurin.

01:05:45.708 --> 01:05:47.000
Thank you, Maurin.

01:05:47.708 --> 01:05:48.833
Thank you.

01:05:49.458 --> 01:05:50.583
Thank you.

01:05:50.666 --> 01:05:52.250
Thank you, Maurin.

01:05:52.333 --> 01:05:54.291
Yes, you're welcome.

01:05:58.416 --> 01:06:01.083
So, you will work here, Moko?

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.250
Not here.

01:06:03.333 --> 01:06:05.916
The cottage will be over there.

01:06:09.916 --> 01:06:11.333
How long will it take?

01:06:12.291 --> 01:06:13.333
I don't know, Wo.

01:06:15.291 --> 01:06:19.416
And I'm sorry
that I'll be away from home for a while.

01:06:20.458 --> 01:06:21.583
Don't apologize.

01:06:23.583 --> 01:06:26.583
We should be thanking you.
You're working for us.

01:06:30.375 --> 01:06:31.458
Thank you.

01:06:31.541 --> 01:06:33.541
No need to thank me.

01:06:33.625 --> 01:06:36.291
That's my responsibility.

01:06:39.875 --> 01:06:41.375
Thank you.

01:06:41.458 --> 01:06:42.958
Ano!

01:06:43.041 --> 01:06:45.000
- Thank you.
- Woko!

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.833
- Thank you.
- Why are you copying them?

01:07:11.375 --> 01:07:13.708
Excuse me, here's the coconut.

01:07:13.791 --> 01:07:15.791
- Yes, thank you.
- Thank you.

01:07:21.625 --> 01:07:22.833
Ais?

01:07:25.666 --> 01:07:26.708
Ais!

01:07:31.791 --> 01:07:35.041
Sorry, Ais is my relative.

01:07:38.291 --> 01:07:42.291
I'm Moko, Mr. Nanang's former student.

01:07:42.375 --> 01:07:45.291
Oh, right. Nanang told me about you.

01:07:45.916 --> 01:07:48.958
Hello. I'm Erna, Nanang's relative.

01:07:49.458 --> 01:07:51.000
- Nice to meet you.
- Yes.

01:07:52.416 --> 01:07:55.041
Thank you for taking care of Ais.

01:07:56.333 --> 01:08:01.166
If she doesn't behave,
just bring her back to me.

01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:08.541
My husband and I had offered
to look after Ais.

01:08:08.625 --> 01:08:12.458
But Nanang seems to have
his own point of view.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.541
Excuse me.

01:08:18.625 --> 01:08:20.000
- Yes.
- Sure.

01:08:29.750 --> 01:08:33.666
- Got you!
- Fine, you want to do three versus one?

01:08:39.250 --> 01:08:43.500
So, the owner of this resort
is the one you'll be working with?

01:08:43.583 --> 01:08:44.625
Yes.

01:08:45.166 --> 01:08:49.958
This is a good opportunity, Moko.
You have to work hard.

01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:53.250
There is no comfortable work.

01:08:53.958 --> 01:08:57.916
Don't tell me you want
that work-life balance thing?

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:02.500
It's a meaningless term
coined by lazy people.

01:09:03.666 --> 01:09:08.291
Yes, Mo. When we were in Melbourne,
Eka worked really hard.

01:09:08.375 --> 01:09:11.000
- That's right.
- All day and night.

01:09:11.791 --> 01:09:13.125
Everyone did.

01:09:13.666 --> 01:09:16.291
Sometimes, a lot of passengers,
sometimes none.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.666
- Passengers?
- Guests!

01:09:19.666 --> 01:09:22.916
She meant clients, Moko.
That's how a business is.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.500
Sometimes it's busy, sometimes it's not.

01:09:25.583 --> 01:09:28.083
Sometimes one or two people
stayed at our house.

01:09:28.166 --> 01:09:30.000
Guests at the house.

01:09:30.083 --> 01:09:31.833
I thought you were an Uber driver.

01:09:31.916 --> 01:09:33.958
Of course not.

01:09:34.041 --> 01:09:37.791
Why leave home and travel so far
just to work as a driver?

01:09:37.875 --> 01:09:39.208
But that's fine too.

01:09:39.291 --> 01:09:42.916
So, what else are you considering now?

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:47.291
We've surveyed all the way here.
You will take the job, right?

01:09:51.875 --> 01:09:53.875
Yes, I'll definitely take it.

01:09:53.958 --> 01:09:55.583
That's great.

01:09:56.291 --> 01:09:59.583
Actually, I'm still worried
about the children.

01:10:00.291 --> 01:10:03.708
I'm worried about Ima.
The project is in Anyer.

01:10:04.250 --> 01:10:05.708
While they're at home and...

01:10:05.791 --> 01:10:08.666
Yes, of course I get that.

01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:12.916
Listen, Mo. Osa and I...

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:17.125
we know how much you've struggled.

01:10:17.708 --> 01:10:21.416
You struggled for two years
and even cancelled your Master's.

01:10:22.208 --> 01:10:25.958
I know that you had been working
as a freelancer.

01:10:26.041 --> 01:10:28.208
Sometimes you earn money,
sometimes you don't.

01:10:28.833 --> 01:10:31.750
You raise Ima
as if she were your own child.

01:10:31.833 --> 01:10:35.875
Not to mention, you also help pay
for your nieces' and nephews' school fees.

01:10:36.458 --> 01:10:41.750
You are amazing.
You're one of a kind, Mo.

01:10:41.833 --> 01:10:45.958
No one would willingly sacrifice their
life for their nieces or nephews.

01:10:46.041 --> 01:10:47.083
You're the only one.

01:10:47.583 --> 01:10:50.375
And you've sacrificed a lot, Mo.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:56.708
Woko gave up a lot of things as well.
He gave up his plans to go to college.

01:10:56.791 --> 01:10:59.750
Woko is happy doing that.

01:10:59.833 --> 01:11:01.583
Every morning I see him.

01:11:01.666 --> 01:11:05.916
He plays guitar every morning.
That's what he wants.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:09.666
Even if you send him to college,
he'll probably be expelled in no time.

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:13.000
Not to mention Ano.

01:11:13.083 --> 01:11:16.750
Woko, Nina, Ima... I understand.
They're your biological nephew and nieces.

01:11:16.833 --> 01:11:18.041
But Ano?

01:11:18.125 --> 01:11:21.666
Ano is Atmo's nephew.
So he's my nephew too.

01:11:22.458 --> 01:11:24.958
Fine, but please.

01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:30.041
Please tell him he eats too much.
Twice as much as the other kids.

01:11:30.125 --> 01:11:31.916
Even more than I do.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:35.791
- Honey, don't say it like that.
- But you saw it too, right?

01:11:36.458 --> 01:11:38.958
He can finish all the food if we let him.

01:11:39.041 --> 01:11:42.291
Yes, Mo. It's true. Ano really eats a lot.

01:11:42.375 --> 01:11:43.333
See?

01:11:46.375 --> 01:11:50.375
Look, this needs to be discussed.
You know why?

01:11:51.125 --> 01:11:54.333
Because I care about you. I do.

01:11:54.416 --> 01:11:56.875
All of us here care about you.

01:11:57.416 --> 01:11:59.500
Yes. Am I right, Maurin?

01:12:02.041 --> 01:12:03.958
This kid is great.

01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:07.916
Sacrificing his youth
for his nephews and nieces.

01:12:08.958 --> 01:12:12.833
In Australia, the sandwich generation.
Right? What is it called here?

01:12:12.916 --> 01:12:14.666
- Same?
- Same.

01:12:14.750 --> 01:12:19.583
People who are stuck with burdens
they shouldn't be responsible for.

01:12:19.666 --> 01:12:23.375
Moko is the sandwich generation.
I feel bad for your girlfriend.

01:12:24.875 --> 01:12:25.833
Right?

01:12:28.125 --> 01:12:32.000
See? Maurin is quiet because she agrees.

01:12:34.875 --> 01:12:40.708
Look, about the children,
let Eka and I handle them.

01:12:40.791 --> 01:12:44.500
It will be good for them
to have parental figures again.

01:12:44.583 --> 01:12:45.625
Right.

01:12:46.833 --> 01:12:51.916
Who is the other kid?
She's not family, but lives here.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.291
- Don't mind it.
- Her name?

01:12:53.375 --> 01:12:55.375
- Ais.
- Yes, her.

01:12:55.458 --> 01:12:57.333
Yes, Mo, what about her?

01:12:57.416 --> 01:13:00.458
She has a relative here. I was surprised.

01:13:01.458 --> 01:13:06.333
You heard it yourself.
Her relative were willing to take her in.

01:13:06.416 --> 01:13:09.541
Why did her father bring her to you?
You're not her family.

01:13:12.041 --> 01:13:15.375
You don't have to act like a hero, Mo.

01:13:15.458 --> 01:13:19.708
You are nice,
but you can't help everyone.

01:13:21.125 --> 01:13:22.750
I've always believed

01:13:22.833 --> 01:13:26.625
the considerate
will always meet the inconsiderate.

01:13:26.708 --> 01:13:28.458
You know which one you are.

01:13:37.083 --> 01:13:43.166
Listen, I understand that right now
you have a lot on your mind.

01:13:43.875 --> 01:13:48.458
Let me do it.
I will talk to her relative.

01:13:49.708 --> 01:13:54.625
Okay? I know how to speak nicely.
I'm an adult.

01:13:54.708 --> 01:13:56.125
The relative is here, right?

01:13:56.208 --> 01:13:57.500
Let me do the talking.

01:13:57.583 --> 01:14:01.250
You just focus on what you're going to do.

01:14:02.291 --> 01:14:03.250
Okay?

01:14:09.041 --> 01:14:12.541
Osa...

01:15:26.250 --> 01:15:27.250
It's okay.

01:15:31.250 --> 01:15:32.291
It's all right.

01:15:37.250 --> 01:15:38.208
Oh, yeah.

01:15:43.708 --> 01:15:45.250
Keep in touch, Ais.

01:15:45.875 --> 01:15:47.041
You too.

01:15:51.333 --> 01:15:52.625
I'm going now.

01:15:57.375 --> 01:15:59.416
- Hey, take care.
- Hey.

01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:00.958
- I'm off now, Woko.
- Yes.

01:16:01.041 --> 01:16:02.500
Bye, No!

01:16:02.583 --> 01:16:04.208
- Take care, okay?
- Yeah.

01:16:06.625 --> 01:16:08.458
- Take care, Ais.
- Bye!

01:16:08.541 --> 01:16:12.416
- Bye, Ais!
- Bye!

01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:13.416
Bye!

01:16:16.125 --> 01:16:17.166
Take care.

01:16:18.083 --> 01:16:19.875
Bye!

01:16:19.958 --> 01:16:21.041
Take care, Ais.

01:16:21.125 --> 01:16:23.666
- Bye!
- Bye!

01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:26.833
- Bye!
- Bye!

01:16:28.291 --> 01:16:29.625
Call us often!

01:16:30.458 --> 01:16:32.375
Bye!

01:16:43.416 --> 01:16:45.000
<i>Did you notice?</i>

01:16:45.541 --> 01:16:47.208
Between the three of us...

01:16:48.083 --> 01:16:52.375
Agnes, me, and you.

01:16:55.083 --> 01:16:56.875
You are the smartest.

01:16:57.791 --> 01:16:59.291
The most diligent.

01:17:00.875 --> 01:17:02.708
And the most obedient to our parents.

01:17:06.958 --> 01:17:10.666
You deserve the most happiness.

01:17:27.708 --> 01:17:31.458
Carry her. Take her on a walk, so...

01:17:31.541 --> 01:17:33.875
Ima, come with me, will you?

01:17:33.958 --> 01:17:36.375
Poor thing, she keeps crying.

01:17:36.458 --> 01:17:40.750
- Ima, want me to carry you?
- Pick her up.

01:17:40.833 --> 01:17:43.000
You want this? I have the one in green.

01:17:43.083 --> 01:17:45.583
Here. You want to hold it?

01:18:27.625 --> 01:18:30.333
Rin, are you sure the cottage
is not too big?

01:18:31.333 --> 01:18:32.750
Is this too big?

01:18:32.875 --> 01:18:35.125
Yes, Mr. Albert asked for 20.

01:18:35.208 --> 01:18:38.458
If we add two here,
they'll be too cramped together.

01:18:38.541 --> 01:18:42.416
Actually, Moko and I have discussed that.

01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:43.791
If--

01:18:43.875 --> 01:18:46.166
- What do you say, Mo?
- Yes, well...

01:18:46.250 --> 01:18:47.916
I'm sorry in advance.

01:18:49.750 --> 01:18:53.500
Don't you think it will be better
if we make it big?

01:18:54.083 --> 01:18:55.000
Why?

01:18:55.708 --> 01:18:58.916
Because Mr. Sam once mentioned

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:03.250
that the interior orientation
for this cottage

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.416
must be functional.

01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:07.875
That's right. Okay.

01:19:08.750 --> 01:19:10.833
But this has to be readjusted.

01:19:11.250 --> 01:19:12.208
Yes.

01:19:12.291 --> 01:19:13.708
Yes, okay.

01:19:13.791 --> 01:19:16.875
Actually, we can still allocate
some space.

01:19:18.291 --> 01:19:20.000
- Sorry.
- Your phone.

01:19:21.250 --> 01:19:23.916
Answer it. I want to make coffee anyway.

01:19:24.666 --> 01:19:25.625
Thank you.

01:19:25.708 --> 01:19:27.291
But we need to take some out.

01:19:27.375 --> 01:19:29.333
- All right. I'll try.
- Take a look first.

01:19:35.750 --> 01:19:36.750
Hello?

01:19:37.708 --> 01:19:38.833
<i>Hello, Moko.</i>

01:19:39.416 --> 01:19:40.916
Yes, Eka. What's up?

01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:44.125
<i>How are you there?
Is work going all right?</i>

01:19:44.708 --> 01:19:45.916
All good.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:47.208
<i>You're in a good health?</i>

01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:48.583
I am.

01:19:49.166 --> 01:19:53.333
<i>Well, I'm calling</i>

01:19:53.416 --> 01:19:58.500
<i>to give you an update.
Everything is fine and good at home.</i>

01:19:59.041 --> 01:20:05.125
<i>But there's this one thing.
The roof is leaking.</i>

01:20:05.208 --> 01:20:08.875
<i>Perhaps because
it hasn't been checked in years.</i>

01:20:08.958 --> 01:20:11.750
Okay, I'll send the money now.

01:20:11.833 --> 01:20:13.625
How much does it cost?

01:20:13.708 --> 01:20:19.500
<i>I actually have all the details
for the repair costs. I'll send them now.</i>

01:20:19.583 --> 01:20:21.375
Yes, thank you.

01:20:21.458 --> 01:20:23.500
<i>- Bye, Moko.</i>
- Bye!

01:20:47.875 --> 01:20:49.875
<i>Hi. So here's the thing...</i>

01:20:49.958 --> 01:20:50.916
<i>Yes?</i>

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:55.208
<i>Osa has a reunion with her friends,
since she just got back.</i>

01:20:55.291 --> 01:21:00.208
<i>I'm thinking maybe
I can buy her something</i>

01:21:00.291 --> 01:21:03.083
<i>to cheer her up.
She's tired, taking care of the children.</i>

01:21:03.166 --> 01:21:05.958
<i>I'm planning to buy her a bag.</i>

01:21:06.041 --> 01:21:08.583
<i>We're all chipping in.
Do you want to help out?</i>

01:21:08.666 --> 01:21:10.125
<i>- Okay.
- Can you help out?</i>

01:21:10.208 --> 01:21:12.666
<i>All right. I'll buy the bag in a bit.</i>

01:21:12.750 --> 01:21:15.166
<i>Can you transfer the money now?</i>

01:21:15.250 --> 01:21:16.666
<i>- I have the money.
- Okay.</i>

01:21:16.750 --> 01:21:18.916
I have it. I'll send the money now, okay?

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.166
<i>Okay. Thank you, Mo.</i>

01:21:26.041 --> 01:21:29.333
- Hey, Mo.
- Hey. What's up?

01:21:29.416 --> 01:21:33.416
Please ask Mr. Naryo
about the plan for this.

01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:34.666
<i>Hello, Mo?</i>

01:21:34.750 --> 01:21:35.791
<i>Yes?</i>

01:21:35.875 --> 01:21:39.000
<i>The water pump at home broke, Mo.</i>

01:21:39.083 --> 01:21:40.750
<i>Oh, no. How come?</i>

01:21:40.833 --> 01:21:42.666
<i>It's been three days.</i>

01:21:42.750 --> 01:21:46.666
<i>It was fixed,
but with my money. It's okay.</i>

01:21:46.750 --> 01:21:48.708
<i>Okay. I'll send the money now.</i>

01:21:48.791 --> 01:21:50.500
<i>No need.</i>

01:21:50.583 --> 01:21:53.291
<i>No, don't say that.
I want to pay you back.</i>

01:21:54.083 --> 01:21:55.208
<i>Okay.</i>

01:22:06.708 --> 01:22:08.416
<i>The number you're calling is busy.</i>

01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:12.791
<i>Please leave a voice message
by pressing star and the number.</i>

01:22:12.875 --> 01:22:15.000
<i>The cost is Rp 400 per minute.</i>

01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:21.125
<i>Moko? Are you busy?</i>

01:22:21.208 --> 01:22:22.750
Not really. What's up?

01:22:22.833 --> 01:22:23.958
<i>How's work?</i>

01:22:24.041 --> 01:22:25.750
Everything's good.

01:22:25.833 --> 01:22:28.791
<i>That's good. Listen...</i>

01:22:28.875 --> 01:22:32.583
<i>I think the kids are tired
eating homecooked meals.</i>

01:22:32.666 --> 01:22:34.958
<i>I should take them out to eat.</i>

01:22:35.041 --> 01:22:37.708
<i>What do they usually like?</i>

01:22:41.416 --> 01:22:43.416
You can take them out to eat.

01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:46.083
<i>Is that so? I can do it once in a while.</i>

01:22:46.166 --> 01:22:49.541
<i>But here's the thing, Mo.
Something's wrong with my credit card.</i>

01:22:49.625 --> 01:22:53.000
<i>It's issued by an Australian bank.
I don't have a bank account here.</i>

01:22:53.083 --> 01:22:55.958
<i>Do you have... Well...</i>

01:22:56.041 --> 01:22:58.833
Yes, of course. For the kids.

01:22:58.916 --> 01:23:01.791
<i>Right. Just for the kids, Mo.</i>

01:23:01.875 --> 01:23:04.125
<i>Maybe just two million.</i>

01:23:04.875 --> 01:23:07.833
<i>Right. Thank you, Mo.</i>

01:23:07.916 --> 01:23:09.708
<i>The number cannot receive calls.</i>

01:23:09.791 --> 01:23:13.541
<i>Please leave a voice message
by pressing the star...</i>

01:24:12.291 --> 01:24:13.333
Mo?

01:24:14.791 --> 01:24:16.000
Yes, Rin?

01:24:17.416 --> 01:24:19.708
Haven't you sent them money every month?

01:24:23.041 --> 01:24:24.000
I have.

01:24:26.458 --> 01:24:27.583
It's okay, Rin.

01:24:29.125 --> 01:24:30.791
But I'm worried.

01:24:31.625 --> 01:24:33.458
Why is it so hard to contact the kids?

01:24:36.625 --> 01:24:38.875
What do you mean "it's okay", Mo?

01:24:41.583 --> 01:24:43.791
It's okay
because that's my responsibility.

01:24:43.875 --> 01:24:45.083
I get it.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:49.375
But you've set the amount
that you will send every month.

01:24:50.458 --> 01:24:54.333
If you keep doing this, Mo,
it won't be good for the kids.

01:24:55.041 --> 01:24:58.416
- But it's for their needs, Rin.
- And what about your needs?

01:25:02.833 --> 01:25:05.291
Living and lifestyle expenses
are different.

01:25:08.250 --> 01:25:10.750
You should be paying
for their living expenses.

01:25:10.833 --> 01:25:12.291
Not their lifestyle.

01:25:12.875 --> 01:25:14.875
The cost of basic necessities to live.

01:25:17.708 --> 01:25:21.416
Money for food, accommodation and school.
Take care of those.

01:25:22.750 --> 01:25:25.958
But the lifestyle?

01:25:26.041 --> 01:25:27.625
To buy a new cellphone...

01:25:28.916 --> 01:25:32.916
to hang out at some coffee shop,
don't worry about it.

01:25:37.458 --> 01:25:40.583
You can calculate living expenses.
But lifestyle...

01:25:41.791 --> 01:25:44.291
If we keep following it, it's endless.

01:25:45.750 --> 01:25:46.791
Trust me.

01:25:48.750 --> 01:25:51.125
I'm also part of the sandwich generation.

01:25:55.666 --> 01:25:59.125
My chat with my dad
looks like a bank statement.

01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:02.416
That's how it is.

01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:05.875
Four days ago my dad asked
for four million to buy dentures.

01:26:07.666 --> 01:26:12.375
Two days ago, he asked for money
for the electricity bill, food and stuff.

01:26:12.458 --> 01:26:14.291
So, there. Like a bank statement.

01:26:15.458 --> 01:26:17.708
I only have my father, child and wife.

01:26:17.791 --> 01:26:19.416
You? How many people? Five?

01:26:20.125 --> 01:26:21.875
- Five.
- Seven.

01:26:22.916 --> 01:26:24.625
Eka and Osa?

01:26:24.708 --> 01:26:27.083
Are you supporting...

01:26:28.250 --> 01:26:29.875
seven people? Seven relatives?

01:26:30.791 --> 01:26:31.750
Hmm.

01:26:36.916 --> 01:26:39.041
That seems crowded. That's a lot.

01:26:40.208 --> 01:26:41.416
Hey.

01:26:43.083 --> 01:26:46.125
Mr. Sam is really happy with your idea.

01:26:47.791 --> 01:26:48.833
Yes.

01:26:49.500 --> 01:26:52.416
He wants you
to do the presentation tomorrow.

01:26:54.250 --> 01:26:55.500
Is that okay?

01:26:56.333 --> 01:27:00.541
Of course it's okay. You have to try, Mo.

01:27:03.041 --> 01:27:05.333
I'm happy for you.

01:27:05.416 --> 01:27:07.083
That's Mr. Sam.

01:27:07.166 --> 01:27:08.833
He responds to potential.

01:27:10.125 --> 01:27:13.041
I just don't have
anything to do tomorrow. Sorry.

01:27:15.916 --> 01:27:17.291
Thank you.

01:27:23.833 --> 01:27:24.833
Thank you, Rin.

01:27:26.916 --> 01:27:28.625
You're welcome, Mo.

01:27:31.416 --> 01:27:32.625
I also want to thank you.

01:27:33.625 --> 01:27:35.541
I didn't do anything.

01:27:35.625 --> 01:27:38.958
- Hmm.
- "Hmm," what?

01:27:40.166 --> 01:27:42.416
You're going to do
a presentation tomorrow.

01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:46.375
Don't say that, Rin. I...
What if I do something wrong?

01:27:46.458 --> 01:27:50.333
- I'll toss you into the water. Can I?
- Seriously. What if tomorrow Mr...

01:27:51.458 --> 01:27:53.083
I'm serious.

01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:04.083
A little to the right

01:28:05.875 --> 01:28:08.291
Yes, you go up. Up a little.

01:28:08.958 --> 01:28:11.166
Slowly, lower it a little. Yes.

01:28:12.625 --> 01:28:13.708
Excuse us, sir.

01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:18.125
Let's start the meeting.

01:28:18.208 --> 01:28:20.375
Sorry for the wait.

01:28:20.916 --> 01:28:24.583
Okay, then. Good morning, everyone.

01:28:24.666 --> 01:28:27.333
Thank you, Mr. Albert,
for the opportunity.

01:28:27.416 --> 01:28:29.375
Today we will present the design.

01:28:29.458 --> 01:28:30.875
Mr. Bayu will--

01:28:30.958 --> 01:28:35.541
Oh, Sam, I have notes for the interior.

01:28:38.791 --> 01:28:43.541
The interior design needs to be
much more unique than the current one.

01:28:44.583 --> 01:28:48.916
Okay, let's go straight
to the interior, shall we?

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.750
As we discussed yesterday, Mr. Albert...

01:28:52.291 --> 01:28:54.541
Moko will be doing the presentation today.

01:28:54.625 --> 01:28:56.166
- Okay.
- Yes.

01:29:01.875 --> 01:29:02.708
Good morning.

01:29:05.166 --> 01:29:10.291
As Mr. Albert said yesterday,
this resort will be a family resort.

01:29:10.375 --> 01:29:16.000
That's why I designed the interior
with that vision in mind.

01:29:16.083 --> 01:29:19.166
Sorry. Just the simplest thing.

01:29:19.750 --> 01:29:24.125
About the choice of furniture
in the restaurant.

01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:27.458
Right, that one.

01:29:28.041 --> 01:29:30.208
Those chairs without arm rests...

01:29:31.208 --> 01:29:34.791
they will look like a downgrade, Sam.

01:29:39.291 --> 01:29:40.875
Well...

01:29:40.958 --> 01:29:43.041
There is a reason for that. Just a moment.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:45.000
Maurin, may I?

01:29:53.541 --> 01:29:57.333
When a mother's eating
while holding her baby...

01:29:58.041 --> 01:30:00.750
the baby has to be on the side.

01:30:01.416 --> 01:30:04.625
Because while she's eating,
the baby could get food spilled on them.

01:30:06.583 --> 01:30:07.625
Table width?

01:30:09.791 --> 01:30:11.416
Too big, in my opinion.

01:30:12.541 --> 01:30:13.708
Okay, sir.

01:30:15.125 --> 01:30:17.500
The width of the table
must be pretty wide.

01:30:17.583 --> 01:30:20.833
I know this will reduce
the number of tables in the room.

01:30:20.916 --> 01:30:25.333
But when a family sits together,
eating with toddlers,

01:30:25.875 --> 01:30:28.958
certain items should be kept
out of the child's reach.

01:30:29.041 --> 01:30:33.333
It can be dangerous.
Like knives, forks, glasses.

01:30:34.625 --> 01:30:36.125
What's the family room for?

01:30:38.291 --> 01:30:40.666
We're making a resort, not a mall.

01:30:43.916 --> 01:30:45.250
Yes.

01:30:45.333 --> 01:30:48.791
But this is a family resort, right?

01:30:52.916 --> 01:30:55.625
Because the one who changes the diaper...

01:30:57.083 --> 01:31:00.416
and takes the child to the toilet
isn't always the mother.

01:31:02.166 --> 01:31:03.916
Fathers do those things too.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.708
And if the child is a girl,
it's going to be difficult.

01:31:08.208 --> 01:31:09.666
In the nursery room...

01:31:10.250 --> 01:31:13.416
they will see the mothers
who are breastfeeding.

01:31:14.083 --> 01:31:17.750
So if another adult comes in,
it would be uncomfortable.

01:31:26.166 --> 01:31:28.833
But I understand we have to respond...

01:31:29.583 --> 01:31:32.291
to the current
social media marketing strategy.

01:31:32.916 --> 01:31:35.833
At the resort,
there should be lots of photo spots.

01:31:36.875 --> 01:31:40.333
But actually,
we can create a specific branding

01:31:40.958 --> 01:31:42.958
that this family resort

01:31:44.041 --> 01:31:47.458
is very concerned
about the comfort of a family.

01:31:51.166 --> 01:31:52.458
How about this, then?

01:31:53.458 --> 01:31:54.625
The cottage space...

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:58.125
is too big for me.

01:31:59.958 --> 01:32:01.875
I asked for a minimalist design.

01:32:02.458 --> 01:32:04.750
So we can build 30 cottages.

01:32:06.791 --> 01:32:07.958
Okay, sir.

01:32:12.458 --> 01:32:15.125
<i>Actually, when a family is on holiday...</i>

01:32:16.833 --> 01:32:18.500
<i>all they need is to be together.</i>

01:32:22.750 --> 01:32:25.750
<i>A lot of children don't get
to spend time with their parents</i>

01:32:25.833 --> 01:32:27.833
<i>because the parents are busy with work.</i>

01:32:36.541 --> 01:32:39.958
Therefore, the cottage
that I designed is bigger,

01:32:40.041 --> 01:32:42.375
so they can be together.

01:32:43.750 --> 01:32:47.291
<i>Plus, we also provide extra beds.</i>

01:32:55.250 --> 01:32:57.583
Sam, no offense, okay?

01:32:58.958 --> 01:33:00.333
The design you made

01:33:01.416 --> 01:33:04.041
is not what I asked for.
I can call it off.

01:33:08.291 --> 01:33:09.333
For the next draft,

01:33:10.458 --> 01:33:13.375
I want you to make
a smaller cottage space.

01:33:16.708 --> 01:33:17.708
Give me the date.

01:33:23.458 --> 01:33:25.000
- I can't, sir.
- The date?

01:33:25.083 --> 01:33:26.291
I can't, sir!

01:33:26.375 --> 01:33:29.833
You need to change the vision then.
Don't be a family resort.

01:33:33.708 --> 01:33:35.375
When a family is on vacation,

01:33:36.291 --> 01:33:37.708
they want to be together.

01:33:37.791 --> 01:33:39.208
That's the whole point.

01:33:40.500 --> 01:33:43.458
Our cottage is not the thing
that should leave an impression.

01:33:45.083 --> 01:33:48.333
But the memory of them
spending time together.

01:33:49.625 --> 01:33:50.666
You, get out.

01:33:52.708 --> 01:33:54.333
I'm done with you.

01:33:58.708 --> 01:33:59.750
Okay, sir.

01:34:06.958 --> 01:34:08.166
One more thing, sir.

01:34:10.166 --> 01:34:11.708
Your painting is upside down.

01:34:24.333 --> 01:34:28.375
All the points we just discussed,
I will do it myself later.

01:34:29.041 --> 01:34:30.916
Okay.

01:34:32.541 --> 01:34:34.375
- Thank you, Albert.
- Thank you, Sam.

01:34:40.791 --> 01:34:42.416
Mr. Albert, I apologize.

01:34:52.166 --> 01:34:53.291
If you could redo it...

01:34:55.375 --> 01:34:56.750
what would you say to him?

01:35:00.125 --> 01:35:01.291
The same thing.

01:35:02.333 --> 01:35:03.541
But maybe more politely.

01:35:08.375 --> 01:35:11.375
Do you remember
the project for your entrance test?

01:35:13.791 --> 01:35:14.916
I do.

01:35:15.583 --> 01:35:17.000
That was my first project.

01:35:19.916 --> 01:35:21.125
I failed.

01:35:22.333 --> 01:35:24.208
I presented it the same way you did.

01:35:30.083 --> 01:35:31.708
You do that one more time,

01:35:33.416 --> 01:35:34.666
and I will fire you.

01:35:38.500 --> 01:35:39.541
Yes, sir.

01:35:43.125 --> 01:35:45.166
Thank you, sir. And I'm sorry.

01:35:47.583 --> 01:35:49.916
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

01:36:11.250 --> 01:36:12.375
Maurin, I'm sorry.

01:36:16.500 --> 01:36:17.833
You miss the kids?

01:36:40.500 --> 01:36:41.333
Moko?

01:36:42.166 --> 01:36:46.875
- Ais, you're selling drinks now?
- Yes, I'm helping Auntie Erna.

01:36:46.958 --> 01:36:48.208
No school?

01:36:49.625 --> 01:36:52.291
It's Saturday. No school on Saturday.

01:36:53.958 --> 01:36:56.291
Take a seat please. I'll call Auntie Erna.

01:36:56.833 --> 01:36:59.000
- Later.
- Later?

01:37:09.541 --> 01:37:11.666
- Ais.
- Yes?

01:37:12.666 --> 01:37:14.250
Do you miss playing the piano?

01:37:18.916 --> 01:37:19.875
I do.

01:37:24.500 --> 01:37:26.375
Actually, it's Dad that I miss.

01:37:30.291 --> 01:37:32.541
Because, I don't know...

01:37:34.333 --> 01:37:36.166
Every time I play the piano...

01:37:38.750 --> 01:37:41.791
it feels like my dad is here.

01:37:42.416 --> 01:37:43.625
With me.

01:37:46.541 --> 01:37:47.750
I'm weird, huh?

01:37:50.250 --> 01:37:51.541
Have you felt like that?

01:37:52.791 --> 01:37:57.416
Doing something just to feel
that the person is still here?

01:38:02.625 --> 01:38:04.041
Ais.

01:38:06.333 --> 01:38:08.750
Have you heard from your dad at all?

01:38:15.791 --> 01:38:22.458
I tried to contact him multiple times,
but never get a response.

01:38:25.416 --> 01:38:27.791
I don't think he's coming back.

01:38:45.625 --> 01:38:46.958
<i>This is Ais.</i>

01:38:47.041 --> 01:38:50.125
Hi, nice to meet you.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:52.125
Would you like a drink?

01:38:52.916 --> 01:38:55.583
- Anything is fine.
- Okay.

01:39:06.458 --> 01:39:11.000
<i>That day Dad brought me to your house,</i>

01:39:11.583 --> 01:39:16.541
<i>I knew he wouldn't come back to get me.</i>

01:39:18.333 --> 01:39:21.541
<i>I knew because...</i>

01:39:22.166 --> 01:39:24.250
I had heard Dad and Mom fighting.

01:39:26.583 --> 01:39:31.000
Neither of them wanted to
take care of me if they split up.

01:39:37.291 --> 01:39:40.125
But I also hesitated at that time.

01:39:40.666 --> 01:39:46.208
When Dad told me to choose
between living here with Aunt Erna

01:39:46.291 --> 01:39:48.458
or with you in Jakarta.

01:39:50.166 --> 01:39:54.875
But personally, I feel bad for Aunt Erna.

01:39:55.666 --> 01:39:57.541
She's also struggling here.

01:40:02.375 --> 01:40:06.000
But turned out,
your life in Jakarta was not easy either.

01:40:08.416 --> 01:40:09.541
Like...

01:40:11.625 --> 01:40:14.791
You already have four children
that you have to take care of.

01:40:15.958 --> 01:40:17.583
A lot of people depending on you.

01:40:20.416 --> 01:40:24.708
And suddenly I showed up.

01:40:29.041 --> 01:40:30.375
I'm sorry.

01:40:37.333 --> 01:40:39.875
Well, my dad...

01:40:43.208 --> 01:40:44.750
and my mom,

01:40:45.833 --> 01:40:51.125
you, and now Auntie Erna.

01:40:52.375 --> 01:40:53.583
I feel like...

01:40:55.375 --> 01:40:59.333
wherever I go, I always end up
being a burden to others.

01:41:10.875 --> 01:41:12.208
Ais.

01:41:12.833 --> 01:41:14.083
Yes?

01:41:14.166 --> 01:41:15.583
If you press this...

01:41:16.958 --> 01:41:18.166
can you hear the note?

01:41:19.666 --> 01:41:20.875
Press it?

01:42:39.166 --> 01:42:40.666
<i>Thank you for visiting me.</i>

01:42:41.833 --> 01:42:45.125
I promise I will do better.

01:42:47.083 --> 01:42:51.416
<i>So I won't be a burden to Auntie Erna
or anyone else.</i>

01:42:54.958 --> 01:42:56.333
<i>You're not a burden to me.</i>

01:42:58.166 --> 01:43:00.041
<i>- I always have been.
- No.</i>

01:43:00.125 --> 01:43:01.166
<i>- I was.
- No.</i>

01:43:01.250 --> 01:43:03.625
<i>I was a burden in your house, right?</i>

01:43:03.708 --> 01:43:05.041
<i>- No.
- I was.</i>

01:43:05.125 --> 01:43:06.250
No.

01:43:07.250 --> 01:43:08.833
I burdened you.

01:43:08.916 --> 01:43:14.333
That's why I, Nina, Woko and Ano,
we all have to work.

01:43:14.416 --> 01:43:17.916
We all work hard
so that we won't burden you anymore.

01:43:22.375 --> 01:43:24.583
What do you mean, Ais?

01:43:32.666 --> 01:43:34.958
Mo, calm down.

01:43:35.041 --> 01:43:35.916
I can't, Rin.

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:36.875
But you can't...

01:43:36.958 --> 01:43:40.250
Hear me out first? Please!

01:43:40.333 --> 01:43:42.000
- Eka is horrible, Rin.
- I know.

01:43:42.083 --> 01:43:43.791
I can't just stay here.

01:43:43.875 --> 01:43:46.875
Mo? Moko! Mo!

01:43:46.958 --> 01:43:48.083
What, Rin?

01:43:55.750 --> 01:43:57.583
Just take my car.

01:43:58.333 --> 01:43:59.458
I will catch you later.

01:44:01.541 --> 01:44:03.833
How long will you wait for a travel van?

01:44:05.666 --> 01:44:07.958
The kids need you, Mo. Just go.

01:44:12.416 --> 01:44:13.625
Go!

01:44:22.375 --> 01:44:25.708
<i>Do you know where the others work?</i>

01:44:29.708 --> 01:44:32.166
Woko...

01:44:33.750 --> 01:44:35.833
<i>he said he worked in a photocopy place.</i>

01:44:35.916 --> 01:44:37.583
<i>But he's happy.</i>

01:44:38.375 --> 01:44:42.500
<i>Because it was close to... Wait.
It's right next to the Trisakti campus.</i>

01:44:42.583 --> 01:44:44.916
<i>That's his dream campus.</i>

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:46.458
<i>So he said...</i>

01:44:46.541 --> 01:44:49.916
<i>he can take a peek
at the students' assignments.</i>

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:51.458
<i>He can learn from those.</i>

01:44:54.208 --> 01:44:55.791
<i>As for Nina...</i>

01:44:56.666 --> 01:44:59.291
<i>I didn't quite understand.</i>

01:44:59.375 --> 01:45:01.041
<i>She said that she</i>

01:45:01.125 --> 01:45:04.916
<i>worked at a restaurant
where she had to be mean.</i>

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:08.166
<i>Something like that.
I don't really get the concept.</i>

01:45:10.041 --> 01:45:12.083
<i>And Ano...</i>

01:45:13.416 --> 01:45:15.166
<i>he's a construction worker now.</i>

01:45:15.250 --> 01:45:19.166
<i>He said he could lose weight
while he was at it. I'm not sure.</i>

01:45:21.250 --> 01:45:22.916
<i>It's actually dangerous.</i>

01:45:34.750 --> 01:45:37.541
Hey, Mo? You didn't tell me
you're coming home.

01:45:37.625 --> 01:45:38.833
Where is Eka?

01:45:39.750 --> 01:45:42.958
He's out of town for work.
What's the matter?

01:45:43.041 --> 01:45:44.666
Why did he make them work?

01:45:47.250 --> 01:45:48.375
Calm down, Mo.

01:45:52.416 --> 01:45:55.416
Wasn't the money I sent you enough?

01:45:55.958 --> 01:45:57.833
Mo, calm down.

01:45:58.958 --> 01:46:00.833
Osa, please just answer.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:03.208
The money was enough.

01:46:03.875 --> 01:46:06.125
But at the moment, Eka used the money

01:46:06.208 --> 01:46:08.458
- for an investment--
- He used the money?

01:46:09.250 --> 01:46:13.000
But the profit will be bigger.
You'll get it back. It's been proven.

01:46:13.083 --> 01:46:14.250
Proven?

01:46:14.333 --> 01:46:16.875
- The kids are working.
- Eka is great at investing.

01:46:16.958 --> 01:46:20.625
- Osa, the kids are all working!
- You just need to be patient.

01:46:22.083 --> 01:46:25.375
Have you ever heard
of something called binary options?

01:46:26.625 --> 01:46:28.458
It involves billions of rupiah.

01:46:28.541 --> 01:46:30.208
When the money grows,

01:46:30.291 --> 01:46:34.083
not only the children,
even you can also stop working.

01:46:38.791 --> 01:46:40.375
How long has Eka been gone?

01:46:41.916 --> 01:46:43.333
About two months.

01:46:48.958 --> 01:46:50.708
That's a fraudulent investment.

01:46:52.083 --> 01:46:53.500
We won't get the money back.

01:46:56.041 --> 01:46:57.750
How do you know it's a scam?

01:46:58.958 --> 01:47:01.666
Mo? Moko?

01:47:04.750 --> 01:47:05.791
Mo?

01:47:22.625 --> 01:47:26.916
Hello, Ima. Hello.

01:47:30.500 --> 01:47:32.583
I'm sorry I left you.

01:47:38.250 --> 01:47:41.875
I'll go and get your siblings.
You'd love that?

01:47:45.666 --> 01:47:46.791
You'd love that, huh?

01:47:53.708 --> 01:47:55.041
Thank you, No.

01:48:03.500 --> 01:48:05.333
- Is it good?
- Here, No.

01:48:06.500 --> 01:48:07.750
Excuse me.

01:48:10.083 --> 01:48:11.125
Ano?

01:48:17.625 --> 01:48:18.666
Moko?

01:48:19.666 --> 01:48:20.875
Let's go home.

01:48:23.333 --> 01:48:26.000
Give me a minute. I'm not finished yet.

01:48:36.083 --> 01:48:39.041
Sir?

01:48:39.125 --> 01:48:42.125
Can I borrow your tools to help my nephew?

01:48:43.041 --> 01:48:45.708
- You want to help?
- Yes, I know how to do it.

01:48:46.833 --> 01:48:48.583
- Return it soon.
- Okay.

01:48:48.666 --> 01:48:49.666
- Thank you.
- Sure.

01:48:58.041 --> 01:49:01.833
It was Eka, right?
He said you were a burden?

01:49:10.666 --> 01:49:14.916
Do you remember when you were sick
and I cancelled my plan to buy a laptop?

01:49:17.750 --> 01:49:19.375
I was really grateful...

01:49:23.083 --> 01:49:24.625
that you were okay.

01:49:25.166 --> 01:49:29.458
But you almost didn't get the job
because of me.

01:49:30.125 --> 01:49:32.208
Because you didn't buy the laptop.

01:49:42.083 --> 01:49:43.958
That's right.

01:49:44.041 --> 01:49:45.458
But I can find another job.

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:50.750
Money can be earned.

01:49:52.083 --> 01:49:53.541
But the main thing for me...

01:49:55.125 --> 01:49:56.583
is your health, No.

01:49:58.875 --> 01:50:01.833
I work for you.

01:50:09.625 --> 01:50:11.125
If something happens to you...

01:50:14.833 --> 01:50:16.875
who will finish the rice at home?

01:50:31.500 --> 01:50:32.541
Woko.

01:50:39.041 --> 01:50:40.583
When did you get here?

01:50:41.625 --> 01:50:42.708
Wo.

01:50:43.500 --> 01:50:45.458
Don't listen to Eka, okay?

01:50:46.083 --> 01:50:48.750
No way. Not anymore. He's insane.

01:50:48.833 --> 01:50:51.791
- Woko...
- I never liked him from the start.

01:50:52.750 --> 01:50:54.458
He speaks nonsense.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:59.166
He said, nothing is free in this life,
that's why we have to work.

01:51:00.208 --> 01:51:01.916
I feel so bad for the kids.

01:51:07.416 --> 01:51:10.250
A construction worker, right?
Great. In construction.

01:51:10.333 --> 01:51:12.125
He doesn't listen. He's impossible.

01:51:13.208 --> 01:51:15.708
Okay, then. Where's Nina, Wo?

01:51:16.958 --> 01:51:21.833
That girl. She's also hard to deal with.
She should focus on college.

01:51:30.500 --> 01:51:31.708
I'm sorry.

01:51:34.375 --> 01:51:35.416
Thank you, Wo.

01:51:39.875 --> 01:51:42.375
Come on! Let's get Nina.

01:51:45.125 --> 01:51:46.333
I'll clean up here first.

01:51:50.625 --> 01:51:52.500
Why are you smiling?

01:51:52.583 --> 01:51:54.083
- Just a moment.
- Okay.

01:51:54.916 --> 01:51:57.583
You better look for another place to work.

01:51:57.666 --> 01:52:00.250
- But, sir--
- You've been here for a month.

01:52:00.333 --> 01:52:02.500
I don't think this job
is suitable for you.

01:52:06.666 --> 01:52:08.416
I can do it. I'll try again.

01:52:08.500 --> 01:52:10.208
That's not how it works, Nina.

01:52:11.458 --> 01:52:14.458
How about this.
We have customers there. Serve them.

01:52:14.583 --> 01:52:17.875
We'll see what you can do.
I'm not sure you can, though.

01:52:17.958 --> 01:52:20.708
- I will try. I know I can.
- What are you waiting for?

01:52:34.875 --> 01:52:35.916
Hi.

01:52:38.166 --> 01:52:39.208
Na, let's go home.

01:52:48.250 --> 01:52:49.708
Read it, tell me your orders!

01:52:52.791 --> 01:52:55.541
I can tell by your look,
you don't have money.

01:52:55.625 --> 01:52:57.916
Don't let me see you order
one meal to share!

01:52:58.916 --> 01:53:01.583
That's how she's supposed to serve.
With anger.

01:53:02.666 --> 01:53:04.375
Do your job well!

01:53:04.458 --> 01:53:06.500
She yells. We chill.

01:53:08.333 --> 01:53:09.375
Na.

01:53:10.250 --> 01:53:11.416
Stop working.

01:53:12.458 --> 01:53:14.333
Don't listen to Eka.

01:53:15.083 --> 01:53:19.333
You've never been a burden to me.

01:53:19.416 --> 01:53:21.625
- The others--
- You all are giving me trouble!

01:53:21.708 --> 01:53:23.916
What's taking you so long? Can't you read?

01:53:27.250 --> 01:53:29.916
Don't order.
Your brother is paying, right?

01:53:30.583 --> 01:53:31.833
Can't you see his face?

01:53:32.541 --> 01:53:36.083
He's young, he has hopes,
he has a future ahead of him.

01:53:36.166 --> 01:53:40.333
Instead, you behave like leeches
and suffocate him. Don't you get it?

01:53:44.375 --> 01:53:46.083
And you, you're an idiot, Moko!

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.166
Why let your family leech off you?

01:53:52.125 --> 01:53:56.625
You should go, Moko!
Leave, work, live your own life!

01:53:56.708 --> 01:54:00.208
We are responsible for our own lives.
Why worry about others?

01:54:00.291 --> 01:54:01.333
And for what?

01:54:06.416 --> 01:54:07.916
Are you trying to be a hero?

01:54:11.166 --> 01:54:12.291
Nina...

01:54:13.333 --> 01:54:14.291
I...

01:54:17.625 --> 01:54:20.083
I don't want to be a burden
anymore. I'm sick of it!

01:54:20.166 --> 01:54:21.625
I can survive by myself!

01:54:21.708 --> 01:54:23.958
- Nina!
- Na!

01:54:24.833 --> 01:54:27.291
- Na!
- Na! Nina!

01:54:32.166 --> 01:54:33.458
Nina!

01:54:34.250 --> 01:54:35.208
Nina!

01:54:38.708 --> 01:54:39.875
Nina!

01:54:45.833 --> 01:54:47.166
Eka ran away, Na.

01:54:49.416 --> 01:54:51.458
Eka ran away with all the money!

01:54:54.208 --> 01:54:57.541
He said all those things
so he can run off with the money!

01:55:00.458 --> 01:55:01.458
Na!

01:55:05.208 --> 01:55:06.833
Eka ran away.

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:13.958
He had all of you working...

01:55:17.750 --> 01:55:21.416
so that he could escape with the money.

01:55:26.666 --> 01:55:30.208
None of you are my burden.
You're not a burden.

01:55:32.833 --> 01:55:33.958
Nina.

01:55:42.833 --> 01:55:44.166
Let's go home.

01:56:06.958 --> 01:56:08.000
Nina.

01:56:10.166 --> 01:56:11.708
Ano, Woko.

01:56:14.166 --> 01:56:15.208
Stop working, okay?

01:56:19.791 --> 01:56:22.250
What's wrong? I've explained it to you.

01:56:22.958 --> 01:56:26.166
Even if Eka didn't take the money,
we still burdened you.

01:56:27.958 --> 01:56:29.125
No, Nina.

01:56:29.708 --> 01:56:30.833
We are.

01:56:30.916 --> 01:56:32.541
No, we're family.

01:56:34.208 --> 01:56:35.916
Mo, I want to say something to you.

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:37.291
Me too.

01:56:38.625 --> 01:56:39.791
You have done so much.

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:42.666
Hang on, Wo. What is it now?

01:56:42.750 --> 01:56:44.500
You supported me earlier.

01:56:44.583 --> 01:56:45.916
I did.

01:56:47.083 --> 01:56:50.083
- But Nina has a point.
- How?

01:56:50.166 --> 01:56:53.500
Nina is right.
If you used the money to buy a laptop...

01:56:53.583 --> 01:56:55.125
This would never happened.

01:56:55.208 --> 01:56:56.958
Hang on. One at a time.

01:56:57.041 --> 01:56:59.041
I agree, the children are a burden, Mo.

01:56:59.125 --> 01:57:00.541
Why are you saying that, Rin?

01:57:00.625 --> 01:57:01.833
It is true, Mo.

01:57:01.916 --> 01:57:03.041
- No, Rin. What--
- No...

01:57:03.125 --> 01:57:06.250
- I never see them as a burden.
- Don't be naive.

01:57:06.333 --> 01:57:08.958
That's just Eka talking.
It's a lie and I don't agree.

01:57:09.041 --> 01:57:12.541
- What he's thinking--
- Listen. I'm trying to explain.

01:57:12.625 --> 01:57:14.458
- What is this?
- Moko.

01:57:20.666 --> 01:57:22.083
How about this?

01:57:22.166 --> 01:57:25.083
So everyone can speak,
raise your hand if you want to speak.

01:57:25.625 --> 01:57:28.541
Okay? We'll listen to whoever is talking
until they're done.

01:57:28.625 --> 01:57:29.666
What?

01:57:30.208 --> 01:57:33.125
So, Moko picked me up
at the construction site.

01:57:33.708 --> 01:57:38.625
He told me
that we have never been a burden to him.

01:57:39.708 --> 01:57:41.458
Deep down inside...

01:57:42.750 --> 01:57:46.125
Moko truly wants to care for all of us.

01:57:48.125 --> 01:57:50.666
Moko has been like a father figure to me.

01:57:52.041 --> 01:57:53.791
So you don' think you're a burden?

01:57:53.875 --> 01:57:54.958
No.

01:57:55.041 --> 01:57:57.458
- You want to stop working?
- I still do, though.

01:58:00.416 --> 01:58:01.666
What?

01:58:05.375 --> 01:58:07.666
Let's say that Eka said that to us

01:58:07.750 --> 01:58:10.000
so he could take the money
you sent for us.

01:58:10.083 --> 01:58:11.583
Mind your words!

01:58:13.458 --> 01:58:14.583
That's the reality.

01:58:16.166 --> 01:58:20.583
It's an investment, it takes time.
Do you understand?

01:58:22.916 --> 01:58:24.916
Can you give that excuse to my school?

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.541
Use that investment excuse
to Ano's school?

01:58:29.083 --> 01:58:30.208
You can't, can you?

01:58:30.291 --> 01:58:33.000
Because the money is gone
and we can't get it back.

01:58:33.083 --> 01:58:34.500
That's enough.

01:58:34.583 --> 01:58:37.541
Osa, if you want to join
the conversation, come here.

01:58:49.666 --> 01:58:50.833
Okay. Go on.

01:58:53.375 --> 01:58:56.208
All right, let's say
Eka didn't touch the money.

01:58:56.291 --> 01:59:01.041
But the fact that Moko worked
tirelessly for us, day and night,

01:59:01.125 --> 01:59:02.166
that's still true.

01:59:03.666 --> 01:59:06.041
The fact is we are a burden. A hassle!

01:59:06.125 --> 01:59:07.083
Nina!

01:59:09.750 --> 01:59:10.791
Not a burden.

01:59:11.541 --> 01:59:13.750
What family doesn't cause trouble?

01:59:16.666 --> 01:59:18.083
Fine, say you're a hassle.

01:59:20.041 --> 01:59:21.875
But have I never hassled you?

01:59:21.958 --> 01:59:23.083
Never!

01:59:24.791 --> 01:59:28.375
I took your sandals once
when you were about to use them.

01:59:28.458 --> 01:59:30.333
- That's one.
- No, I have other sandals.

01:59:31.666 --> 01:59:32.708
Woko.

01:59:33.916 --> 01:59:36.625
You had to put off college
to take care of Ima

01:59:36.708 --> 01:59:39.291
when I started working.
That must have been a hassle.

01:59:39.875 --> 01:59:42.083
It's fun to play with Ima,
it's not a hassle.

01:59:44.333 --> 01:59:45.333
Nina.

01:59:46.583 --> 01:59:50.041
You cook for everyone
in this house everyday.

01:59:50.625 --> 01:59:51.666
A hassle, right?

01:59:51.750 --> 01:59:57.791
We never felt burdened by you
because you are so kind to us.

02:00:02.625 --> 02:00:03.666
That's the thing.

02:00:06.625 --> 02:00:09.875
You don't think
you've all been kind to me as well?

02:00:11.416 --> 02:00:12.958
That you love me?

02:00:17.208 --> 02:00:19.041
We're family.

02:00:19.125 --> 02:00:22.833
There's no such thing
as being troublesome or a burden.

02:00:24.125 --> 02:00:25.916
All of you, quit your jobs.

02:00:26.625 --> 02:00:28.625
I work morning, noon, night.

02:00:29.291 --> 02:00:32.416
Not once did I think about
asking you to repay me.

02:00:36.250 --> 02:00:38.708
What kind of grownups will you become...

02:00:40.416 --> 02:00:42.875
if you believe you owe something
to your family?

02:00:56.083 --> 02:00:57.125
Okay.

02:00:57.875 --> 02:01:01.791
I agree with Moko.
No one here is a burden.

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:07.375
But I don't believe
the kids should not be allowed to work.

02:01:07.458 --> 02:01:09.958
What's this?
Why are you encouraging them to work?

02:01:10.041 --> 02:01:12.541
Except for the construction job.
You hear me, Ano?

02:01:13.291 --> 02:01:14.958
You're too young, it's dangerous.

02:01:15.041 --> 02:01:17.500
- Okay.
- Find another job, okay?

02:01:18.875 --> 02:01:19.916
Okay.

02:01:21.916 --> 02:01:25.375
It's okay, Mo. It's okay for them to work.

02:01:25.458 --> 02:01:27.250
Not because they feel indebted.

02:01:28.916 --> 02:01:31.708
- Rin, you don't understand--
- What, Mo?

02:01:31.791 --> 02:01:32.916
Want to break up again?

02:01:34.458 --> 02:01:35.500
You can't, can you?

02:01:36.708 --> 02:01:38.000
We're not even dating.

02:01:45.625 --> 02:01:47.166
How long will this go on, Mo?

02:01:47.250 --> 02:01:50.208
How long will you stop me
from standing up for you?

02:01:53.666 --> 02:01:55.416
I want to live with you, Mo.

02:01:57.500 --> 02:01:58.750
The kids want it too.

02:02:01.375 --> 02:02:04.125
We're all here to support each other,
can we do that?

02:02:30.333 --> 02:02:31.541
Okay.

02:02:53.791 --> 02:02:54.750
Mo?

02:02:57.625 --> 02:02:58.666
Mo?

02:02:59.458 --> 02:03:00.458
Hey.

02:03:04.750 --> 02:03:06.750
We will do this together.

02:03:24.958 --> 02:03:26.125
Can I join you?

02:03:27.833 --> 02:03:29.208
You're sticky.

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:31.375
Let it be.

02:03:52.291 --> 02:03:53.583
Would you like that?

02:04:11.541 --> 02:04:13.166
<i>But have you ever done that?</i>

02:04:14.666 --> 02:04:19.666
Doing something...

02:04:20.291 --> 02:04:22.708
just to feel
that the person is still here?

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:41.583
What's the personal reason
you chose the open concept?

02:04:42.666 --> 02:04:44.583
I don't want the academic explanation.

02:04:44.666 --> 02:04:47.750
But I want to hear
the personal reason, from the heart.

02:04:52.166 --> 02:04:54.333
Come on in.

02:04:55.750 --> 02:04:58.500
- Need any help?
- I'm fine.

02:05:27.041 --> 02:05:29.916
By knocking down the wall...

02:05:31.250 --> 02:05:33.708
we'll have a more spacious area

02:05:34.791 --> 02:05:36.958
for everyone to gather.

02:05:57.083 --> 02:05:58.500
I'm home.

02:06:08.291 --> 02:06:10.416
- Ais?
- Ais?

02:06:16.416 --> 02:06:17.958
<i>Any news from Eka?</i>

02:06:29.208 --> 02:06:30.541
I'm sorry.

02:06:31.875 --> 02:06:34.333
Don't worry about it.

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:37.875
I'm sorry.

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:45.291
Osa?

02:06:51.750 --> 02:06:52.958
What's wrong?

02:06:53.041 --> 02:06:56.125
Nothing. Your hair looks nice.

02:06:59.291 --> 02:07:00.208
Really?

02:07:02.958 --> 02:07:04.416
Let's eat together.

02:07:09.916 --> 02:07:12.250
Now your hair looks similar to mine.

02:08:34.833 --> 02:08:37.708
